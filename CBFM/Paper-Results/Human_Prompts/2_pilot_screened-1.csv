0,A comparison of frameworks and objectives for implementation of marine protected areas in Northern Europe and in Southeast Asia,"A proliferation of marine protected areas around the world, including Europe and Southeast Asia, is evidence of a growing global concern for the marine environment and its living resources. While marine protected areas in Europe on a wider scale have generally been considered a tool for either nature conservation or a technical measure in management of fisheries, overall management objectives of marine protected areas in Southeast Asian countries have varied more significantly between countries and sites due to differences in societal needs and opportunities, spatial scales, environmental conditions and varying threats. These differences have resulted in different approaches to marine protected area development and management. Management of the Northern European marine environment and its living resources is highly sectoral and largely determined by central directives and policies stemming from the European Union, such as the Habitats Directive and the Common Fisheries Policy. This paper however, will touch upon an ongoing evolution within the European Union from a strictly sectoral approach to marine protected areas and marine management, towards a more integrated, ecosystem approach to management of fisheries and the marine environment. In Southeast Asia, marine protected area development is usually determined by individual governments, municipalities and coastal communities, based upon specific needs and settings. Examples of such marine protected areas in Vietnam and the Philippines will be described, including their underlying institutional frameworks and objectives such as tourism, management of artisanal fisheries, etc. Examples of differences and similarities between Northern European and Southeast Asian marine protected areas will be presented and areas in which regions might learn from one another identified. For instance, where Southeast Asian protected areas have addressed the inevitable interdependency between healthy ecosystems and sustainable coastal fisheries for decades, marine protected areas in Northern Europe usually address either large scale management of stocks of individual fish species or nature conservation. Tourism has long been an overarching driving force in marine protected area implementation in SE Asia, while in Northern Europe especially this has only had little influence on overall objectives pertaining to the marine environment.

1,"Antenatal care in rural Bangladesh: Current state of costs, content and recommendations for effective service delivery","Background: Measurement of antenatal care (ANC) service coverage is often limited to the number of contacts or type of providers, reflecting a gap in the assessment of quality as well as cost estimations and health impact. The study aims to determine service subcomponents and provider and patient costs of ANC services and compares them between community (i.e. satellite clinics) and facility care (i.e. primary and secondary health centers) settings in rural Bangladesh. Methods: Service contents and cost data were collected by one researcher and four interviewers in various community and facility health care settings in Gaibandha district between September and December 2016. We conducted structured interviews with organization managers, observational studies of ANC service provision (n = 70) for service contents and provider costs (service and drug costs) and exit interviews with pregnant women (n = 70) for patient costs (direct and indirect costs) in health clinics at community and facility levels. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine any different patient characteristics between community and facility settings. ANC service contents were assessed by 63 subitems categorized into 11 groups and compared within and across community and facility settings. Provider and patient costs were collected in Bangladesh taka and analyzed as 2016 US Dollars (0.013 exchange rate). Results: We found generally similar provider and patient characteristics between the community and facility settings except in clients' gestational age. High compliance (> 50%) of service subcomponents were observed in blood pressure monitoring, weight measurement, iron and folate supplementation given, and tetanus vaccine, while lower compliance of service subcomponents (< 50%) were observed in some physical examinations such as edema and ultrasonogram and routine tests such as blood test and urine test. Average unit costs of ANC service provision were about double at the facility level ($2.75) compared with community-based care ($1.62). ANC patient costs at facilities ($2.66) were about three times higher than in the community ($0.78). Conclusion: The study reveals a delay in pregnant women's initial ANC care seeking, gaps in compliance of ANC subcomponents and difference of provider and patient costs between facility and community settings. © 2019 The Author(s).",No,No,The paper does not meet the screening criteria as it does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The paper does not mention CBFM or any Pacific Island country.

2,When a Shark Is More Than a Shark: A Sociopolitical Problem-Solving Approach to Fisher-Shark Interactions,"Fisheries are often conceptualized through a biophysical lens resulting in management approaches that fail to account for stakeholder conflicts and sociopolitical inequities. Using a fisher engagement approach, this case study examines the sociopolitical dimensions of fisher-shark interactions in pursuit of more complete problem definitions and effective solutions. Through interviews with Hawai‘i small boat fishers and observations of a community-based shark-tagging project, we examined fisher perspective, socioeconomic landscapes, stakeholder relationships, and power dynamics. We interpreted these data using an adapted framework that mobilizes concepts from conflict theory and problem definition. We discovered that economic cost, sharks as fishing competitors, and factors of fishers' on-the-water decisions define the fisher-shark interaction problem at the dispute level. Deeper conflicts include fishers' poor perceptions of management legitimacy, degraded relationships with researchers and managers, threatened fisher identities, and poor enforcement capacity. Together, dispute and deeper conflicts limit the effectiveness of singular approaches (e.g., regulation) to mitigate fisher-shark interactions and necessitate multi-pronged solutions with substance-, process-, and relationships-based components. This case study documented one such multi-pronged strategy employing fisher-researcher knowledge exchange, collaborative research, and means of more transparent communication. This strategy has the potential to affect both dispute- and deeper-level outcomes by advancing collective understanding of sharks and shark-handling tools, fisher behavior, and reducing shark mortality. Thus, a sociopolitical approach to problem-solving may yield greater collective benefits to fisheries stakeholders and sharks, with broader implications for the systemic management of complex human and biophysical ecosystem components.

3,Prospects of community-based co-management of Philippine abalone fishery,"The Philippine abalone fisheries has been in a continuous decline in the last two decades. From an all-time high of 633 mt in 2004, exports declined to 218 mt in 2008. Reasons cited for the decline are the harvesting of abalone juveniles and broodstock, indiscriminate and destructive methods of harvesting, occurrence of disasters due to anthropogenic and natural causes, and the absence of a management plan for abalone. This paper explores the prospect of community-based co-management (CBCM) approach in addressing the decreasing production of abalone from the wild. The challenges faced by women and men abalone fishers-absence of organized abalone fishers, weak implementation of fishery laws and lack of policy for abalone management, general lack of knowledge on the biology of abalone, and the much needed co-management arrangement with various stakeholders, provide a very fertile ground for community organizing. Community organizing as an over-all strategy in the implementation of the four interrelated components of CBCM provide some prospects for better management of abalone fisheries. The four components of CBCM are: resource management that aims to protect, conserve, regulate and improve the management of abalone fishery resources; community and economic development and livelihood which hopes to widen the socio-economic opportunities to improve people's well-being; capacity building that aims to increase people's knowledge on the biology of abalone and their awareness on the need for its judicious management; and, institutional support, networking and advocacy that hopes to enable the various stakeholders-fishers, LGUs, academe, research institutions to work together and share in the benefits of management. The sharing of responsibilities and authority based on each partner's resources and capacities may be a contentious issue but CBCM has to deal with it. While CBCM is not a one-size-fits-all strategy to address the complex issues of fisheries management, the challenges present in the different study areas call for a CBCM approach that is adaptive and context-specific. The collective learning process innate in CBCM shall provide the best alternatives that will ensure that abalone fisheries will be sustained. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",No,No,"the study discussed in the abstract is not from a Pacific Island country, so it does not meet the SC."," No; the abstract discusses the Philippine abalone fishery, which is not a Pacific Island country.

4,"Not satisfactory, but still acceptable: Exploring socioeconomic incentives of individual quota systems in Japanese Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries from the management leaders’ perspective","The individual quota (IQ) system is a rights-based management system that has been implemented in many countries, despite its lack of quota transferability. The purpose of this study was to explore the incentives behind the introduction of a non-transferable IQ system from the management leaders’ perspective through comparative case study of three Japanese Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) fisheries with different community units. In 2019–2020, process tracing was conducted through semi-structured interviews with fisheries management staff, prefectural governments, and fishing cooperative associations who play an important role in introducing the IQ system in each community. In each case, in order to set allocations and to manage catch quotas, local fishers could participate in the council or by attending meetings. With a high priority for complying with the defined PBF catch quotas, the IQ system was finally introduced, either as a standalone system or combined with other management methods. While the non-transferable IQ systems in the case studies were not necessarily selected as satisfactory, but still considered acceptable, our data suggests that socioeconomic incentives, including revenue improvement and ensuring equity, were important. These incentives were not triggered by the system per se, but were due to a well-functioning co-management system. Recently, there has been a shift from voluntary IQ systems to government-led ones based on the revised Fisheries Act. Future trends should continue to be monitored, as government-led systems have stricter rules that may hamper the socioeconomic incentives described above. © 2023 The Authors",No,No,"The study does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country, thus it does not meet the SC."," No; The study focuses on Japanese Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries and does not mention any Pacific Island country.

5,"Stroke care in the next decades: A projection derived from a community-based study in Umbria, Italy","Recently published data show that stroke incidence is no longer declining, while case fatality rates has had a less pronunced fall in recent years than in the past. Projections of the increasing number of elderly people, combined with the greater risk of stroke in old age, suggest that in the forthcoming decades we will be faced with an increased request of health resources for patients with stroke. We have therefore used data from a community-based study on stroke incidence and outcome to project the number of first ever strokes, death from stroke and handicap from stroke in Italy, up to the year 2016. Results show that incidence will increase by 22.2%, and death at 6 months from first ever stroke by 29%. However, since patients already handicapped for other reasons are more likely to die from their stroke, the net number of newly handicapped persons will only increased by 5%. These results suggest that in the next decades the major increase in request of health care resources will result from the acute event and the immediate post-ictal phase, and not from the management of chronic handicap after a stroke. © 1993 Gustav Fisher.",No,No,The paper does not meet the required SC as it does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The Title and Abstract do not mention CBFM or Pacific Island countries.

The vegetation in the silvofishery pond consisted of Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, and Avicennia marina. Silvofishery pond was introduced with an area total of 8,484 m2, with an area of 0.4242 ha in each pond of dominated seedlings and saplings, respectively. In the predominated seedling density over sapling showing almost twice found that seedling density consisted of 297 individual/ha which domination of R. apiculata compared to sapling density of 144 individual/ha.

7,"Feasibility and Acceptability of Brighter Bites: A Food Co-Op in Schools to Increase Access, Continuity and Education of Fruits and Vegetables Among Low-Income Populations","Intake of fruits and vegetables (F&V) continues to be low in children in the United States. The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot feasibility evaluation of Brighter Bites, a school-based food co-op to provide access to fresh F&V and nutrition education to low-income children and their families. Brighter Bites is a 16-week school-based food co-op consisting of: (1) Weekly distribution of 50–60 servings of fresh F&V; (2) Weekly bilingual parent handouts and recipe demonstrations; and (3) implementing CATCH, a coordinated school health program in schools. Brighter Bites was pilot tested using a pre-post evaluation design in one charter school in Houston, TX, USA (n = 57 3rd grade parent–child dyads; 94.1 % Hispanic, 91 % low-income). Evaluation, at baseline, midpoint, and post-intervention, included self-reported child and parent surveys on psychosocial factors, dietary habits and mealtime practices. Pearson’s Chi square test, Fisher’s exact-test or paired t test were used to determine changes pre- to post-intervention (at p < 0.05). Process data using parent surveys, teacher surveys, attendance logs, and produce cost data were used to determine feasibility and acceptability of program. Participants received on average 61 servings of F&V weekly for 16 weeks at the cost of $4.31/family/week. Results showed significant increases in child reported self-efficacy, outcome expectations and attitudes towards consuming F&V (p < 0.05). We found significant increases in child exposure to F&V and child preference of various F&V from baseline to post-intervention (p < 0.05). Parent surveys showed significant improvements in mealtime practices at home: decrease in children eating while watching TV, increase in eating dinner with the family, less fast food, less sugary drinks with meals, more children asking for F&V as snacks.

8,"Integrating science and technology to support stream naturalization near Chicago, Illinois","Many urban and suburban communities in the Midwest are seeking to establish sustainable, morphologically and hydraulically varied, yet dynamically stable fluvial systems that are capable of supporting healthy, biologically diverse aquatic ecosystems - a process known as stream naturalization. This paper describes an integrated research program that seeks to develop a scientific and technological framework to support two stream naturalization projects near Chicago, Illinois. The research program integrates theory and methods in fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, hydraulic engineering and social theory. Both the conceptual and the practical challenges of that integration are discussed. Scientific and technical support emphasize the development of predictive tools to evaluate the performance of possible naturalization designs at scales most appropriate to community based projects. Social analysis focuses on place based evaluations of how communities formulate an environmental vision and then, through decision making, translate this vision into specific stream naturalization strategies. Integration of scientific and technical with social components occurs in the context of community based decision making as the predictive tools are employed by project scientists to help local communities translate their environmental visions into concrete environmental designs. Social analysis of this decision making process reveals how the interplay between the community's vision of what they want the watershed to become, and the scientific perspective on what the watershed can become to achieve the community's environmental goals, leads to the implementation of specific stream naturalization practices.",No,No,The paper does not meet the Screening Criteria as it does not include any case study on CBFM in Pacific Island countries.," No; The paper's title and abstract do not mention any CBFM case study in Pacific Island countries.

9,Trade-offs between conservation and development in community-based management initiatives,"Community-based management (CBM) has attracted much interest as a conservation and development strategy in natural resource-dependent communities in recent decades. However, most initiatives fail to achieve both objectives. The most analyzed CBM strategies in the literature include donor- and govern-ment-driven initiatives, but other types exist as well. The research objective was to identify the internal and external factors that influence the trade-offs between conservation and development in three internally driven CBM initiatives in Latin America: a long-term indigenous-based conservation strategy, the constitutional recognition of ancestral land rights of Afro-American communities and artisanal fisheries management. The results showed that livelihoods depend on natural resources, but none of the cases identified a balance between conservation and development. Community activities are not the primary cause of natural resource degradation. Conservation is supported by ethnicity and cultural values and is challenged by current development models and worldviews that push intensification of resource use and by power asymmetries. Internal pressures include limited rule compliance and enforcement authority to stop free-riding and unauthorized activities. Internal challenges for development include the lack of capacities, rigid rules and non-inclusive CBM, and the inertia and risk aversion that prevail in many communities. External challenges include the lack of economic incentives and compensation models that enable welfare opportunities linked to sustainable management. © 2017, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

11,A model of collaborative programming to address wildlife issues: The northeast wildlife damage management research and outreach cooperative,"Wildlife abundance has grown for several species that are adapted to human-dominated landscapes. Overabundant wildlife may cause nuisance concerns and property damage, or spread zoonotic diseases such as West Nile virus, particularly at the suburban-rural interface of many communities. Consequently, wildlife damage management has become an important component of the wildlife profession. The complicated biological and human dimensions of human-wildlife conflicts often require partnerships between state and federal agencies, universities, local governments, communities, and private wildlife control professionals. The Northeast Wildlife Damage Management Research and Outreach Cooperative (WDM Coop) was formed to enhance coordination and collaboration among wildlife agencies, universities, and other cooperators to promote consistent, multi-state approaches for resolving wildlife-related concerns. During 2001-2004, 12 projects have been funded to examine issues associated with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), black bear (Ursus americanus), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), and beaver (Castor canadensis). These projects have focused on a diverse array topics from community-based efforts to control deer populations, to aversive conditioning techniques for black bears. The Northeast Fish and Wildlife Agency Directors decided to exclude projects focusing on zoonotic diseases and human health issues from the list of WDM Coop activities. There have been focused efforts concerning human dimensions inquiry and outreach publications for wildlife management professionals. As state fish and wildlife agency budgets grow tighter and staff numbers are reduced, we believe more regional centers or wildlife management cooperatives will be formed to meet the increasing demand for services from multiple states with shared issues and concerns. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",No,No,The abstract does not meet the screening criteria as it does not include any information about a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The abstract does not mention any Pacific Island country or CBFM.

In the oceanic islands of Fernando de Noronha, Atol das Rocas, and Trindade, only the first has a permanently staffed station. The program was initiated in 1980 to investigate and implement a program for the conservation of sea turtles. As a direct result of TAMAR's efforts, the harvest of gravid females and of eggs has ceased in all major nesting areas. The success of the program is based on local participation of the fishing villages, including the employment of former egg poachers to patrol the beaches and protect the nests, education programs, and ecotourism. The majority of stations are staffed year round and not only promote the conservation of endangered sea turtles, but also organize community festivals, support local schools and health care facilities, and assist in developing alternative sources of income for residents who once relied on the exploitation of sea turtles.

14,The renaissance of community-based marine resource management in Oceania,"Twenty-five years ago, the centuries-old Pacific Island practice of community-based marine resource management (CBMRM) was in decline, the victim of various impacts of westernization. During the past two decades, however, this decline has reversed in various island countries. Today CBMRM continues to grow, refuting the claim that traditional non-Western attitudes toward nature cannot provide a sound foundation for contemporary natural resource management. Limited entry, marine protected areas, closed areas, closed seasons, and restrictions on damaging or overly efficient fishing methods are some of the methods being used. Factors contributing to the upsurge include a growing perception of scarcity, the restrengthening of traditional village-based authority, and marine tenure by means of legal recognition and government support, better conservation education, and increasingly effective assistance, and advice from regional and national governments and NGOs. Today's CBMRM is thus a form of cooperative management, but one in which the community still makes and acts upon most of the management decisions.",Yes,Maybe,"The abstract mentions CBMRM in various island countries, but it is unclear if there is a specific case study in a Pacific Island country."," Maybe; The abstract mentions CBMRM in various island countries, but it is unclear if there is a specific case study in a Pacific Island country.

15,Evaluation of the effectiveness of three underwater reef fish monitoring methods in Fiji,"Locally based and volunteer-based monitoring approaches have recently received greater attention as a cost-effective way to collect data on the environment and/or involve stakeholders in management. The present study compared three monitoring methods based on an underwater visual census (UVC) of reef fish in a customary area in Navakavu (Viti Levu Island, Fiji). Two non-scientific approaches involved (1) snorkellers from the village using vernacular names for five local focal fish taxa and (2) non-resident volunteers using the Reef Check target list of fish for the Indo-Pacific (nine focal taxa). These approaches were cross-checked with a comprehensive scientific survey (all fish recorded at the species level across 12 families). The three methods were compared in terms of accuracy, precision, and ability to highlight changes in fish abundance between the community-managed no-take zone (NTZ) and the fished area. We found that scientific and volunteer-based data were consistent in terms of means and variance of abundance estimates but that Reef Check focal taxa would not be suitable for monitoring the Navakavu marine area. On the contrary, the locally selected target taxa were appropriate but overestimates and imprecision were noticed in the fish counts made by the community members. Differences in abundance of two major target taxa (Lethrinidae and Mullidae) between the NTZ and the harvest area were not validated by the scientific observations. Calibration of community-based UVC is thus needed especially if information from the local biological monitoring program is used to guide management actions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",No,Maybe,"While the paper does not mention CBFM explicitly, the focus on community-based monitoring in a Pacific Island country could be related to CBFM.

16,Socio-economic impacts of shrimp culture,"Farmed shrimp contributed 27% of total world shrimp production in 1995 with a volume of 712 000 tonnes. Undoubtedly, the shrimp culture industry earns valuable foreign exchange for developing countries and generates jobs across the industry from fry gatherers to growers and processors. However, grave socio-economic consequences - including conversion, expropriation and privatization of mangroves and other lands; salinization of water and soil; decline in food security; marginalization of coastal communities, unemployment and urban migration; and social conflicts - have followed in the wake of shrimp farm development in the Philippines and other tropical countries. The paper focuses on mangrove ecosystems: the valuation and cost-benefit analysis of their goods and services, and the mangrove-offshore fisheries connection. Research gaps in these areas and the need to internalize the ecological and socio-economic costs ('externalities') of shrimp farming are highlighted.

17,Community-based scenario planning: a process for vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning to social–ecological change in coastal communities,"The current and projected impacts of climate change make understanding the environmental and social vulnerability of coastal communities and the planning of adaptations important international goals and national policy initiatives. Yet, coastal communities are concurrently experiencing numerous other social, political, economic, demographic and environmental changes or stressors that also need to be considered and planned for simultaneously to maintain social and environmental sustainability. There are a number of methods and processes that have been used to study vulnerability and identify adaptive response strategies. This paper describes the stages, methods and results of a modified community-based scenario planning process that was used for vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning within the context of multiple interacting stressors in two coastal fishing communities in Thailand. The four stages of community-based scenario planning included: (1) identifying the problem and purpose of scenario planning; (2) exploring the system and types of change; (3) generating possible future scenarios; and (4) proposing and prioritizing adaptations. Results revealed local perspectives on social and environmental change, participant visions for their local community and the environment, and potential actions that will help communities to adapt to the changes that are occurring. Community-based scenario planning proved to have significant potential as an anticipatory action research process for incorporating multiple stressors into vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning.

18,Emergence of co-management governance for Hawai'i coral reef fisheries,"Governance failures associated with top-down management have spawned a myriad of institutional arrangements to engage resource users in decision-making through co-management. Although co-management can take many forms and may not always lead to positive outcomes, it has emerged as a promising governance option available to meet social and ecological goals. Recent research on co-management of small-scale fisheries has used comparative approaches to test factors associated with social and ecological success. Less is known however, about how co-management institutional arrangements emerge and persist in the face of socioeconomic and environmental change. Here, we examine the emergence of co-management governance using a case study from coral reef fisheries in the Hawaiian Islands. We used a mixed methods approach, combining a robust policy analysis and a set of key respondent interviews to trace the evolution of this co-management arrangement. Our research uncovers a set of linked drivers and social responses, which together comprise the emergence phase for the evolution of co-management in this case study. Drivers include resource depletion and conflict, and social responses comprise self-organization, consensus building, and collective action. We share insights on key factors that affect these phases of emergence, drawing on empirical findings from our policy review and key respondent interviews. We conclude by describing ways that our findings can directly inform policy and planning in practice, including the importance of documenting the 'creation story' that spawned the new institutional arrangement, ensuring that enabling conditions are present, the complexity of defining community, the connection between process legitimacy and outcomes, and understanding the costs and timelines associated with co-management governance transitions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",No,No,The study does not meet the SC as it does not include a case study from a Pacific Island country.," No; The study focuses on a case study from coral reef fisheries in the Hawaiian Islands, which is not a Pacific Island country.

20,Indigenous knowledge in the beach seine fisheries in Sri Lanka: An indispensable factor in community-based fisheries management,"Small-scale fishing over the globe is based primarily on fisher indigenous knowledge (IK), accumulated through many generations of close interactions between people and the natural world. Community-based beach seine fisher communities of southern Sri Lanka were studied through standard ethnographic methods to ascertain the traditional method in using fishers' IK, and explore empirically the accuracy in using those methods distilled from the traditional fishers. Study revealed that, inter alia, traditional fishers use IK to predict the commencement of fishing season, and identify and quantify the species composition occurring at their fishing territory. Ten traditional methods those which are important for identifying and quantifying the fish school were distilled. Explored methods frequently used by traditional fishers were based on the changes of seawater color (folk oceanography) and the behaviour of sea terns (Sterna sp.). Traditional fishers' responses on frequency of utility of explored methods in day-to-day fishing activities were in accordance with the findings of the empirical study. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that PC score loading in fishers' expectation and fishers' realization had a positive significant relationship (r=0.814, p<0.001). This indicated that traditional fishers' expectation on composition and quantity of fish school arriving at fishing territory (ex-ante) is accurate and reliable at the realization (ex-post). As such, there exist opportunities to fisheries co-management for the coastal fisheries in Sri Lanka, incorporating fishers' indigenous knowledge in resource exploitation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",No,No,"The study was conducted in Sri Lanka, which is not a Pacific Island country as required by the SC."," No; The study was conducted in Sri Lanka, which is not a Pacific Island country.

21,Sustainable financing of a national Marine Protected Area network in Fiji,"Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are mostly studied from an environmental context. A review of available information identified a lack of knowledge in sustainable mechanisms to finance MPA networks. At the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2017, Fiji reaffirmed its voluntary commitment to make 30% of its inshore and offshore marine area MPAs by 2020 under Sustainable Development Goal 14. The work presented here uses empirical data to explore potential benefits from selected community-based MPAs to recipient local stakeholders. A Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Willingness to Contribute Time (WtCT) method was used to explore the extent to which bottom-up governance systems represent a potential financing mechanism of a MPA network. Results of 115 interviews concluded that proximity to a fishing market, dependence on marine resources, food security, income and international commitments were significant variables influencing stakeholder's WTP and WtCT to manage a MPA. We argue that there is a discrepancy between WtCT and WTP driven by income constraints. Thus, by using WTP and WtCT to support financing of a MPA network, a Provincial Trust Fund (PTF) could promote an equitable and benefits-based contribution. Equally important, a PTF has a polycentric and decentralized governance model, which endorses sustainable management of traditional fishing communities.

22,"Scaling up of eco-bio-social strategy to control aedes aegypti in highly vulnerable areas in Fortaleza, Brazil: A cluster, non-randomized controlled trial protocol","Aedes aegypti is a cosmopolitan vector for arboviruses dengue, Zika and chikungunya, disseminated in all Brazilian states. The Eco-Bio-Social (EBS) strategy is vital in Aedes aegypti control as it mobilizes stakeholders (government, professionals, society, and academics) to promote healthy environments. This paper describes the rationale and methods of expanding the EBS strategy for Aedes aegypti control in Fortaleza, Northeast Brazil. A cluster, non-randomized controlled clinical trial was developed to analyze the strategy’s effectiveness in vulnerable territories (high incidence of dengue and violent deaths; low HDI; substandard urban infrastructure, high population density, and water scarcity). We selected two intervention and two control groups, resulting in a sample of ap-proximately 16,000 properties. The intervention consisted of environmental management by sealing large elevated water tanks, introduction of beta fish in waterholes, elimination of potential breeding sites, and mobilization and training of schoolchildren, endemic disease workers, health workers, social mobilizers, and community leaders; community surveillance of arboviruses; construction and validation of a booklet for the prevention of arboviruses in pregnant women. We analyzed the costs of arboviruses to government and households, the intervention cost-effectiveness, chikungunya’s chronicity, and acceptance, sustainability, and governance of vector control actions. The primary outcome (infestation) was analyzed using the house, container, and Breteau indices. We hope that this study will help us understand how to scale up strategies to fight Aedes aegypti in vulnerable areas. © 2021 by the authors.

23,Differential impacts of coral reef herbivores on algal succession in Kenya,"In shallow-water systems, fisheries management influences herbivory, which mediates ecosystem processes by regulating algal biomass, primary production, and competition between benthic organisms, such as algae and corals. Sea urchins and herbivorous fishes (scrapers, grazers, browsers) are the dominant herbivores in Kenya's fringing coral reef and their grazing influences coral-macroalgal dynamics and dominance. Using experimental substrata and grazer exclusions, we tested the hypothesis that herbivores differentially affect algal composition and succession using 3 levels of fisheries management: fished reefs, community-managed closures (&lt;10 yr old, &lt;0.5 km2), and government-managed closures (20 to 40 yr old, 5 to 10 km2). In fished reefs and government closures, herbivores facilitated maintenance of early successional algal species, such as turfs, associated with sea urchins in the former and scraping fishes in the latter. Crustose coralline algae were only abundant in government closures, and video recordings showed that fish grazing was greatest at these sites, most notably for parrotfishes (scrapers). A combination of sea urchins and small grazing and detritivorous fishes was present in community closures, which allowed macroalgae to quickly develop from turf into early then late successional stages. These reefs may represent an intermediate or transitional system of herbivore dominance characterized by macroalgae. Consequently, reefs in heavily fished seascapes initially protected from fishing may require additional management efforts to facilitate the recovery of larger-bodied scraping fishes, including bans on capturing parrotfishes and restricting gear (e.g. spearguns) that target these species. © Inter-Research 2014.",No,No,The study does not meet the Screening Criteria as it does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The study does not mention CBFM or any Pacific Island country.

24,Characterization of an artisanal fishery in Argentina using the social-ecological systems framework,"Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) studies how institutions (the rules of the game of a society) determine the performance of a social-economic system. Elinor Ostrom extends the institutional analysis to the collective action for a particular case, the study of the social-ecological systems (SESs) (Ostrom 1990). Any group that attempts to manage a common resource (e.g. aquifers, pastures) for optimal sustainable production must solve a set of problems in order to create institutions to facilitate collective action. Some evidences show that following a set of design principles in creating institutions can lead to overcome these problems. The aim of the paper is to apply the SES framework to an artisanal fishery community in Argentina in order to: 1) describe the principal features, key variables and relations of the small-scale fishery system; 2) detect the principal drivers of a potential common-management and the leading detractors from the current communal performance; and 3) analyze the possibility that a self-governing for sustainable fishery may appear. Several drivers for potential common-management and some detractors from the current common performance are summarized. Artisanal fishery SES is currently at a bifurcation point. A common historical and cultural root, the presence of leaderships, the relevance of local knowledge, the dependence on the resource to sustainable livelihoods and the threat of big-scale fisheries area have generated incentives to collectiveaction. But, simultaneously, internal conflicts are the most important barrier for an integrated community-based management. The heterogeneity among actors and the relevant external conditions have resulted in two groups diverging in their self-organization. The work is framed by the project COMET-LA (COmmunitybased Management of Environmental challenges in Latin America; European Commission’s Seventh Framework Programme of Research and Development), which aims to identify sustainable community-based governance for the management of natural resources that can be used in different social-ecological systems in a context of climate change and increasing competition in the use of resources. © 2017, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

25,Application of the Ostrom framework in the analysis of a social-ecological system with multiple resources in a marine protected area,"The framework proposed by Ostrom (2009) has become one of the most utilized tools to address the complexity of social-ecological systems. Most cases use this framework to analyze the systems from the perspective of a single resource unit. However, the livelihoods in several coastal communities are diverse, so that the users interact with multiple common-pool resources, which makes their analysis difficult. In this sense, it is important to identify the key elements of management to achieve the sustainable use of the resources. In this study, we were able to do this in a coastal community where commercial fishing, ecotourism, and recreational fishing coexist. The system of interest, located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was subdivided by resource type using a multi-method approach to data collection including surveys, interviews, and records review. A conceptual map was developed that shows how the second-tier variables are integrated through the governance and actors with the biophysical system. The actors involved in lobster fishing achieved a more complex governance system, followed by the ecotourism and recreational fishing; the complexity of the governance was related with the equity level of the actors. The analysis revealed the research gaps to develop management strategies and improve the sustainability of the system.

26,Participation towards heritage conservation: Case of a fishing community in Langkawi Geopark,"There is an increasing movement towards acceptance of public participation as a logical approach to heritage conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. In conservation initiatives, to ensure effective participation is to see it as a social process. Thus, the importance of community participation and consultation in planning for heritage conservation is emphasised using an example from fishing community involvement in community-based fisheries management in Langkawi. The setting up of cooperative community resource management Komuniti Pengurusan Ekosistem Perikanan (KPEP) is a significant attempt that acknowledges the value of local involvement in natural resource management. It aims to understand local fishers' participation in resource management activities towards heritage conservation. One of the findings revealed that although the resource management activities did not mentioned explicitly the importance of heritage conservation. However it could be assumed that intention for heritage conservation is at the heart of the initiatives. Implicit in such an approach is a sense that local fishers' participation in managing resources would utilise local knowledge gained from past down traditions of previous generations. The application of local knowledge encourages them to become aware of their fishing cultural heritage and to encourage them to conserve it.

27,Evolving governance structures in community-based sandfish mariculture and their interactions with livelihood outcomes: Evidence from the Philippines,"Sea cucumber mariculture is an important emerging field of practice and applied research in the coastal tropics. This is due to the existing importance of tropical sea cucumber fisheries for wealth generation and poverty reduction, and the potential for mariculture to contribute to the longer term sustainability of these fisheries while generating benefits additional to those from wild caught sea cucumber. Understanding the optimal institutional arrangements for sea cucumber mariculture is an important area of focus in this field, with a variety of arrangements currently in place. This paper documents the establishment of a communal form of sea ranching in the Philippines, as a case study of community level institutional processes. It describes the background to establishment of the sea ranch in the community of Victory, challenges encountered and how these were managed, and the evolution of governance arrangements. In charting this process, we assess the impacts on livelihood outcomes, highlighting this as a crucial aspect influencing this evolution and the nature of community involvement in the sea ranch. While the sea ranching project generated a range of benefits for livelihoods, including possible spillover effects for the surrounding fishery, substantial economic returns from harvests did not occur. Thus, the system of governing the sea ranch evolved from a communal model to a more exclusive household model primarily to improve operational efficiency. In order for possible benefits of the sea ranch to be sustained and enhanced, greater integration with fisheries management and government support will be needed.

28,Placing Madagascar's marine turtle populations in a regional context using community-based monitoring,"Madagascar is an important foraging ground for marine turtles in the Western Indian Ocean, yet the status of the country's nesting aggregations remains poorly documented. We assess the current status and trend in nesting throughout Madagascar, including data recorded by a community-based monitoring project in the Barren Isles (western Madagascar). We contextualize the findings in comparison with data from Madagascar's closest neighbouring states. Reports indicate that nesting levels have declined at many coastal sites, with no known recordings since 2000 at > 40 nesting sites. We estimate there are a minimum of 1,200 nests per year in Madagascar, with the largest recorded nesting aggregation (< 1,000 nests per year) found on islands off the west and northern coasts. The majority of nesting aggregations, including those recorded by the community-based monitoring project in the Barren Isles, are relatively small, in the order of < 50 nests per year, yet they are potentially important sources of regional genetic diversity. Nesting on many of the islands (e.g. Tromelin, Europa) around Madagascar has increased over the last 20 years, despite the fact that thousands of turtles probably originating from these sites are taken by fishers in the waters of Madagascar annually.

29,25th anniversary invited paper trends in development of coastal area management in tropical countries: From central to community orientation,"The development phases of coastal management in tropical countries are described. Precolonial, centralized, community based, and collaborative coastal management are identified as forms of management which have evolved to what today is called integrated coastal management. Centralized management began during colonial times when any attempt at management was orchestrated from the top of government. Community based coastal management, in response to the failures of more centralized approaches, began in the Philippines through several projects, the experience of which spread to other countries in Southeast Asia and to Ecuador in the 1980s. The concept of collaborative management is now accepted as a description of variations in joint management arrangements between government and community or with the private sector stakeholders. It is suggested that collaborative management and integrated coastal management are more or less synonymous. The trends identified within tropical coastal management include interdisciplinary research and management integration, valuing traditional knowledge and management systems, increasing reliance on local participation, and using participation oriented research approaches. It is seen that the capacity for improved coastal management is increasing dramatically with a strong emphasis on training through academe and field learning trials.

30,Assessment of the changing levels of livelihood assets in the Kampong Phluk community with implications for community-based ecotourism,"In recent years, international attention has been rendered to development of ecotourism for poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation. We assessed local livelihood assets in Kampong Phluk Community before and after the introduction of the community-based ecotourism (CBET) governance system, where it was previously under the private company management system (SEAPAC). We used a sustainable livelihood framework to assess natural, physical, human, social, and financial assets by analyzing a set of panel data of 150 observations according to the scoring scale of zero (total dissatisfaction) to one (total satisfaction). We found that full implementation of CBET raised the overall average score of livelihood assets by 0.15. In particular, physical capital and human capital achieved remarkable growth by 0.25 to 0.23, respectively, while growth in natural capital and financial capital was statistically insignificant.

31,"Loco or no loco? Holocene climatic fluctuations, human demography, and community based management of coastal resources in Northern Chile","The abundance of the southern Pacific mollusk loco (Concholepas concholepas), among other conspicuous marine supplies, are often cited as critical resources behind the long-term cultural and demographic fluctuations of prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the coastal Atacama Desert. These societies inhabited one of the world’s most productive marine environments flanked by one the world’s driest deserts. Both of these environments have witnessed significant ecological variation since people first colonized themat the end of the Pleistocene (c. 13,000 cal yr BP). Here, we examine the relationship between the relative abundance of shellfish (a staple resource) along a 9,500-year sequence of archeological shell midden accumulations at Caleta (a small inlet or cove) Vitor, with past demographic trends (established via summed probability distributions of radiocarbon ages) and technological innovations together with paleoceanographic data on past primary productivity. We find that shellfish extraction varied considerably from one cultural period to the next in terms of the number of species and their abundance, with diversity increasing during periods of regionally decreased productivity. Such shifts in consumption patterns are considered community based management decisions, and for the most part they were synchronous with large and unusual regional demographic fluctuations experienced by prehistoric coastal societies in northern Chile. When taken together with their technological innovations, our data illustrates how these human groups tailored their socio-cultural patterns to what were often abrupt and prolonged environmental changes throughout the Holocene. © 2017 Wagner, Ding and Jaffé.",No,No,The abstract does not meet the screening criteria as it does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The abstract does not mention any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.

We analyse the anticipated spread of two supranational policies on coastal fisheries in the Pacific region – the 'small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines’ and ‘the New Song’ – in three countries: Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Our approach combines instrumental perspectives on ‘policy coherence’ with cognitive–normative perspectives on ‘policy image’. Accordingly, we use two methods: a document-based comparison of the policies produced at different levels and interviews with national government officers in charge of policy deliberation and delivery. We find supranational-to-national policy coherence across most prescribed policy themes, except for emergent social themes such as ‘gender’ and ‘human rights–based approaches’. The views of government managers substantiate, and further augment, this finding. Crucially, managers' images (encompassing judgements, aspirations and convictions) represent personal and practical attributes involved in policy interpretation and implementation. Multi-scale policy diffusion is thus a translational process mediated by national-level staff, and managers' policy images offer nuanced and dynamic insights into why some policies are slow to take root while others take different shape to their agreed meanings. Analysts and policymakers must consider and mobilise translational approaches and policy images in order to understand and facilitate successful domestic implementation of international agreements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",No,No,There is no mention of any case study on CBFM in a Pacific Island country in the title and abstract.," No; The abstract does not mention CBFM or any Pacific Island country.

34,"Assessment of ecological vulnerability to climate variability on coastal fishing communities: A study of Ungwana Bay and Lower Tana Estuary, Kenya","Fisheries resources are important in supporting the livelihood of many coastal communities especially in the developing tropical countries. Fisheries resources however, continue to face unprecedented pressure from the impacts of climate change, and this presents both ecological and socio-economic challenges to the dependent communities. This paper assessed the ecological vulnerability to climate variability of artisanal fishing communities in Ungwana Bay and the Lower Tana Delta in Kenya, using selected fin fish species. A combination of approaches were adopted and used to identify and determine exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation indicators. These included a critical review of existing literature, socio-economic survey, and computation of temperature and rainfall variation using long term data from 1983 to 2015. The method of Equal Weights (EW) was applied to all indicators after normalization. The data was normalized in a scale of 0–1, where 0 indicated low vulnerability level and 1 high vulnerability. By using composite index, the selected Ngomeni and Ozi fishing communities within the larger Ungwana Bay and Lower Tana Delta indicated high levels of vulnerability of 0.9 and 0.8 respectively. Due to high vulnerability level and poor adaptation capacity by the local fishing communities in the selected study sites, we recommend government and non-governmental agencies to reinforce community based organizations (CBOs) activities on ecological conservation and social network creation to promote short and long term adaptation measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",No,No,"The study does not meet the screening criteria because it is conducted in Kenya, not a Pacific Island country."," No; the abstract mentions Kenya, not a Pacific Island country.

35,The Ghosts of Fisheries Management,"The scientific analysis and management of fisheries has been dominated by three institutional orthodoxies: state regulation, market exchange and community-based management. This paper argues that these static, substantive, metaphors obscure a consideration of the dynamic temporal interplay between stakeholders and their environment. To address this vacuity the paper outlines a process-sociological approach and applies it to the historical development of fisheries management in the Tam Giang Lagoon, in Central Vietnam. The analysis shows that the interplay between different groups of fishers, the Vietnamese state, and the lagoon environment, over time, structures future struggles. As such, this interplay needs to be understood as a causal force of its own in the development of fisheries management.

36,Adaptive capacity of marine comanagement: a comparative analysis of the influence of colonial legacies and integrated traditional governance on outcomes in the Pacific,"Integrating traditional institutions into marine resource comanagement has become common across the Pacific. However, these arrangements can link village-based and centralized governance systems in many ways, resulting in new hybridized institutional organizations, operational scales, and governance process. Examining the context-specific social, cultural, and historical processes that shape these programs can reveal how systems for comanagement develop, and how institutional differences influence adaptive capacity. Using analytical tools drawn from critical institutionalism and broad institutional perspectives, we assess how different institutional histories and processes of hybridization informed the adaptive capacity of two comanagement programs in Samoa: the Community-Based Fisheries Management Programme (CBFMP) and the Marine Protected Area (MPA) program. While the programs were embedded in similar cultural and ecological contexts, the MPA program became inactive following the 2009 Pacific tsunami, while the CBFMP endured. In spite of early efforts to involve communities in the MPA program’s development, the institutional history and organization of the program’s managing agency informed an interpretation of comanagement principles that did not adequately incorporate traditional Samoan institutions for coastal management, reducing its adaptive capacity. In contrast, the CBFMP gained resilience through its fundamental integration with village-based social and political institutions, social norms, and values. This analysis of institutional histories, structures, and program outcomes demonstrates that colonial legacies pose obstacles for successful hybridized governance in the Pacific, while also confirming the valuable contributions integrated traditional institutions can make to improving adaptive capacity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",Yes,Maybe,"While the abstract mentions CBFMP, it is unclear if it is a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country."," Maybe; The abstract mentions the Community-Based Fisheries Management Programme (CBFMP), but it is unclear whether it is a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.

Concern about the limited success of this fishing cooperative led the villagers of Kaba Point. Fiji to ask for biological and socioeconomic studies to determine the roots of the cooperative's problems. The villagers also required an assessment of their proposal to revitalize the cooperative through a development scheme that would enable them to increase their catch. The surveys, undertaken by researchers from the University of the South Pacific and the Fiji Fisheries Division, indicate that the area has been overfished, primarily through the widespread local and commercial use of gillnets and the reliance on fishing as a sole source of village income, and further expansion of the current resource exploitation patterns would be very damaging. In addition, although the cooperative provides an important sense of communalism in the village, only a few people regularly provide fish to the coop. The semi-subsistence lifestyle of rural Fiji is one factor limiting villagers participation in full-time fishing activities. The traditional social and management structures inherent in this village (especially, marine tenure, chiefly responsibility for the community, and a demonstrated history of communal projects) can form a strong basis for a modern community-based marine management program.

45,Evaluation of the Impact of a Pharmacist-Led Telehealth Clinic on Diabetes-Related Goals of Therapy in a Veteran Population,"Objectives Telemedicine has been offered as a way to ensure that all patients, including those who live in rural areas, have access to the same health care. This study was performed to evaluate the benefit of a real-time, clinic-based video telehealth (Clinical Video Telehealth [CVT]) program and the impact of a pharmacist-led CVT clinic for chronic disease state management. The primary objective was to evaluate changes from baseline values, in veterans referred by primary care providers to this clinic. Methods This was a single-center, prospective, pre-post pilot study that also included a post-patient satisfaction survey. The study was conducted at the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, which is composed of two medical centers and 12 community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) located away from the two main facilities. Fifteen clinical pharmacy specialists (CPSs) - seven at the two main facilities and eight at the CBOCs - provide disease state management clinical pharmacy services. One of the seven CPSs at the main facilities works via telemedicine and provides services to the CBOCs where on-site clinical pharmacy services did not exist. The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in A1C, LDL level, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure after 6 months of CVT services by the CPS. Secondary outcomes were the percentages of patients meeting American Diabetes Association treatment goals for hemoglobin A1c (A1C), low-density lipoprotein level, and blood pressure, both individually and in combination after attending a pharmacist-led CVT program; the level of patient satisfaction with pharmacists' care and with CVT as a method of receiving chronic disease management, specifically for diabetes; and medication additions or changes made by the pharmacist. Results Twenty-six patients completed the 6-month evaluation. A significant decrease in A1C of 2% from baseline was observed (p=0.0002), and the percentage of patients meeting goal A1C significantly increased from 0% at baseline to 38% at 6 months (p=0.0007). Overall patient satisfaction scores were also high, with a median score 39.5 (interquartile range 36-40) of a maximum score of 40. Conclusion Six months of CVT clinic attendance significantly improved A1C values and the overall percentage of patients meeting their goal A1C values in this veteran population. In addition, patient satisfaction scores also indicated a high level of satisfaction with the pharmacist-led CVT service. © Published 2016.

46,Modeling short-term fishing dynamics in a small-scale intertidal shellfishery,"We assessed the relative contribution of a set of predictors on the short-term dynamics of the yellow clam intertidal fishery in Uruguay based on a community-based data collection program for five consecutive fishing seasons. Results of generalized linear mixed models showed that the occurrence of fishable days depends on the absence of red tide events and prevailing wind conditions, but also was related to the timing of each fishing event throughout the fishing season. Furthermore, higher fishing yields were coincident with the prevalence of northerly offshore winds. Catch per unit of effort levels of each fishing event were mostly related to interannual characteristics of each fishing season and, to a lesser extent, with fisher attributes (gender and age) and the timing of each fishing event. The adverse effect of red tides and unfavorable environmental conditions impose a high degree of uncertainty in this social-ecological system, leading to economic inefficiency. A key challenge for successful management of the yellow clam fishery and other similar small-scale fisheries relies in considering not only the resource and the governance subsystems, but also the dynamics of the resource users, together with relevant external drivers affecting them. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",No,No,The paper does not meet the SC because it does not include a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The paper does not mention any Pacific Island country.

47,Long-Term Stability of the Faunal Community of a Subtropical Estuary: Evaluating Disturbances in the Context of Interannual Variability,"Estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems can have significant intra- and interannual variability in faunal community structure, complicating management response to disturbances as disturbance effects must be detectable within normal variability and on timescales relevant to management entities. We examined a long-term, multi-gear dataset on estuarine faunal (fish and select invertebrate) communities to determine if community structure changes due to disturbances could be detected on management-relevant timescales (e.g., years), given that these communities have known seasonal and interannual variability. Results from multivariate, community-based analyses, and several univariate diversity indices for fauna of Tampa Bay, Florida, USA suggested general community stability over the long term, with the exceptions of 2005–2006 (prolonged red tide event) and 2010 (extreme cold event in winter). Community structure was notably outside the typical variability for both time periods. In 2005, species richness decreased by half for one gear type and was the lowest on record for the other two gear types. In 2010, when the relative abundance of a top predator decreased by 50% from cold-related mortality, Simpson’s diversity index was the lowest on record for one gear type. The red tide and extreme-cold events differed in duration and the number of taxa directly impacted (multispecies vs. single-species, respectively) but both multivariate and univariate analyses indicated significant deviation in the faunal community structure during these years. Within 1–3 years after these major events, however, the community seemed to have returned to a structure like that of previous years, suggesting long-term stability and resilience. Our results confirm that multivariate and univariate analyses can detect major disturbances to estuarine faunal communities, which gives management entities options for which analysis approach is appropriate for their needs. Since the Tampa Bay faunal communities recovered within 3 years, we suggest that where long-term monitoring exists, active restoration might be deferred while monitoring for signs of recovery following the removal of a perturbation. This is a fundamental part of sound adaptive management processes to promote sustainable ecosystems. © 2020, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",No,No,The paper does not meet the screening criteria as it does not include a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The paper does not mention Pacific Island countries or CBFM.

48,Exclusive economic zones and the management of fisheries in the South China Sea,"The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), with the provisions for defining an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), is the international agreement that has had the greatest influence on the structure of fisheries policies in national and international arenas. It had the profound effect of increasing the contribution of fisheries to the national gross domestic product or GDP. It brought about a redistribution of benefits from fishing from distant water fishing fleets to the coastal states. Investments flowed in to the fisheries sector. Countries that had fisheries resources but limited capacity to exploit them established joint ventures with states that owned fishing fleets (ADB, 1997). The end result was a substantial increase in the contribution of fisheries to the national GDP especially in developing countries and the overall shift in total capture fisheries production from the developed to the developing world (Delgado et al., 2003). The LOSC and the EEZ are strongly associated with ownership and the implication that fisheries will be better managed within some property rights regime. These concepts were modified by coastal states to apply to fisheries management policies at the scale of local governments and even communities. Shortly after the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended in 1982, community-based initiatives to define fishing rights and effectively manage fisheries proliferated. There was a stronger effort to move national policy toward devolution of fisheries management to local government units and encourage co-management and stakeholder participation in the management of coastal resources. There were several efforts to develop Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Plans and establish Community Based Coastal Resource Management (CBCRM) strategies in the Philippines first, and later in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. In this paper, we present case studies where there is a poor institutional fit between the EEZs of coastal states and the natural structure of fisheries resources. This has led to the formulation of inadequate fisheries policies, difficulties in monitoring and controlling the overexploitation of fish stocks, and a massive degradation of fish habi tats vital to the survival and sustainability of stocks. In the first two decades of the LOSC, states have focused on implementing Articles 55-56 and 61-62, which detailed their jurisdiction and right to exploit resources optimally. In this next decade of implementing the LOSC, states will need to consider the provisions for transboundary cooperation detailed in Articles 63 to 67 of Part V of the LOSC. We highlight the importance of knowledge of institutional interplay in fisheries management at the local, sub-national, national and regional scales, and how this relates to the structure of fish stocks and national jurisdiction. We also suggest some research priorities and institutional adjustments required to increase the chances of devising a successful fisheries policy, embody a broader regional perspective of the needs and aspirations of fisheries, as well as national goals.

49,Social dimensions of local fisheries co-management in the Coral Triangle,"SUMMARY The challenge to manage coastal resources within Asia-Pacific's Coral Triangle has gained global attention. Co-management is promoted as a key strategy to address this challenge. Contemporary community-based co-management often leads to 'hybridization' between local (customary) practices, and science-based management and conservation. However, the form of this hybrid has rarely been critically analysed. This paper presents examples of co-management practices in eastern Indonesia and Solomon Islands, focusing in particular on area closures. In contrast to the temporary closures used before the influx of sustainability discourses, contemporary closures are periodically-harvested but predominantly closed, reflecting attempts to reduce fishing effort and enhance ecological sustainability. When areas are opened, harvests are relatively short and largely triggered by the social and economic needs of particular individuals or whole communities. In all cases, engagement with environmental management interventions has led to more formalized access and use arrangements. The harvesting and management practices observed are influenced by these relatively recent interventions designed to promote sustainability, but also by religious institutions, increasing resource demand, and modernization. This study unpacks some of the contemporary influences, particularly environmental sustainability initiatives, on local management practices, and provides insights for co-management in practice.

50,Facing limits in oceanic fisheries: Part I: Extent of the problem and policy responses,"Research from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and fishery scientists indicates that the wild catch offish and other marine life from the oceans will not be able to increase significantly in the future, except through rehabilitation and better management of stocks. Despite the limited potential for bigger catches, fishing fleets have expanded rapidly in recent decades under government subsidies. Fishers now have approximately twice the capacity necessary to make the annual catch from the oceans. The juxtaposition of natural limits and overinvestment has created a crisis situation for the world's fishers, fishing communities and traditional fishing cultures. Part I of this article discusses policy responses at the national and international level. How policy makers respond to the overextension of the marine fishing industry will determine the extent of job loss, hunger and dislocation that will result. Part II, to be published in the Forum's next issue (February 1995), will examine the social aspects of the world's fishing industry, including the demography of fishers, utilization of fisheries products, the relative social contribution of aquaculture and policy responses to overcapacity.

51,Madagascar Fish Eagle productivity in the Tsimembo-Manambolomaty Protected Area and surrounding habitat of western Madagascar,"We monitored the productivity of the critically endangered Madagascar Fish Eagle Haliaeetus vociferoides inside and outside of the Tsimembo-Manambolomaty Protected Area (T-M PA), western Madagascar from 2010 to 2015. We recorded 14 breeding pairs inside and 13 outside T-M PA. The T-M PA and surrounding habitat hosted respectively 10 and six breeding polyandrous pairs, composed of one adult female and two adult males. During the six-year study period, 101 eggs were laid in nests in T-M PA of which 60 hatched and 58 young fledged. We recorded 62 eggs laid in nests outside the T-M PA of which 39 hatched and 36 young fledged.

52,Hidden benefits and risks of partial protection for coral reef fisheries,"Partially protected areas are now the dominant global form of spatial management aimed at preserving ecosystem integrity and managing human use. However, most evaluations of their efficacy use only a narrow set of conservation indicators that reflect a fraction of ways in which protection can succeed or fail. In this paper, we examine three case studies of partially protected coral reef fishery systems to evaluate benefits and risks of their use as a management tool. We use data from community-based management arrangements in three Pacific Island countries to demonstrate three vignettes of how partial protection can boost fisheries production, enhance the ease with which fishers catch their prey, and alter the composition of fisheries yields. These changes in fisheries productivity, catchability, and vulnerability under partial protection carry substantial benefits for fishers. However, they also carry significant risks for ecosystems and fisheries livelihoods unless adaptively managed so as to confer the short to medium term benefits in resource performance without risking longer term sustainability. © 2022 by the author(s).

53,A theory of scaling for community-based fisheries management,"Community-based approaches to fisheries management has emerged as a mainstream strategy to govern dispersed, diverse and dynamic small scale fisheries.

We draw on literature of agriculture innovations to provide a framework that takes into account process-driven and structural change occurring across multiple levels of governance, as well as different phases of scaling.

55,"Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia: A perspective on its transborder hydrological and resources governance","Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in South East Asia, being situated at the heart of the Mekong River Basin. Governance of the lake over the recent past has been weak and overly complex, and the basin governance structure has changed over time in terms of its fisheries management framework. The governance framework initially focused on the commercial exploitation of fish resources, but has more recently switched to a community-based fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and open access model. This study discusses how the water flows occurring between the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake complicate the governance of the lake, and particularly its fisheries, biodiversity, land and water management activities. The establishment of the Tonle Sap Authority (TSA) in 2007 sought to address the governance challenges facing the lake.

62,A role for partially protected areas on coral reefs: Maintaining fish diversity?,"Completely banning fishing from coral reefs is now accepted to have significant benefits for marine biodiversity and in many cases, fisheries. However, the benefits of regulating fishing on coral reefs, by restricting the methods used, or the total amount of fishing, are less well understood, even though such regulations are much more likely to be supported by fishermen. This study assesses whether banning illegal, destructive fishing methods and reducing the numbers of fishermen visiting from outside an area benefits a coral reef fishery, despite unregulated fishing by local fishermen using non-destructive methods. The abundance, biomass, mean length, and species richness of nine commercially important fish families are compared across ten independent patch reefs inside and outside the 470km2 Menai Bay Conservation Area in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Even after taking into account the effect of differences in habitat and the distance between reefs, 61% (±19.7%) more fish species were found in regulated than unregulated reefs.

64,Transformations of Vietnamese shrimp aquaculture policy: Empirical evidence from the Mekong Delta,"International environmental and social concerns about tropical shrimp production have led to the emergence of private transnational governance and regulation. Using cases from Ca Mau we investigate how the shift to private transnational regulatory networks has changed the role of the government from a regulator to a facilitator of global private governance interests and arrangements.

67,Sri Lankan reservoir fishery: A case for introduction of a co-management strategy,"The inland fisheries of Sri Lanka are essentially artisanal on most of the reservoirs in the country. The annual inland fish production declined dramatically after 1990, when state patronage for the development of the inland fisheries was discontinued for 4 years. This decline was shown to be a result of growth overfishing of the two dominant cichlid species which accounted for over 90% of landings. This was a result of using small mesh (<6.9 cm) gillnets in the absence of the State-sponsored monitoring procedure in the fishery after 1990. This indicates that it is necessary to monitor inland fisheries management in Sri Lanka through a centralized authority in the current situation. However, in some Sri Lankan reservoirs, fishing communities can be categorized as 'organized' because they collectively make decisions to define procedures for the rational exploitation of the fishery resources. In reservoirs with 'organized' fishing, the communities themselves have developed mechanisms tto regulate the landing sizes of dominant cichlid fish species through community-based fisheries management strategies. In such reservoirs, over-exploitation of fish stocks was not evident, even after 1990, when state-sponsored monitoring procedures were suspended. Based on these observations, an alternative approach is recommended for the management of Sri Lankan reservoir capture fisheries in which the Government and resource-users have equal responsibilities in the management of the resources.",No,No,The study does not meet the screening criteria because it is not a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The study is about the Sri Lankan reservoir fishery, which is not in a Pacific Island country.

68,"Will small MPAs work?: The case of small-sized MPAs in Southern Iloilo, Philippines","Most of the marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Philippines are small-sized and community-based, and their contribution to the conservation efforts have been usually overlooked. This paper will present the results of the biological assessment study conducted in three community-based MPAs in Southern Iloilo, Philippines. Each MPA has a 2-ha no-take zone and this size is way below the recommended optimal size of 10–100 km2. Results show that fish biomass showed an overall increase of about 1–5 times. This is attributed to both an increase in abundance and in fish size. Fish in this survey conducted in 2013 were about 2.3–3.3 times the size of fish in the 2007 baseline data. Macroepifaunal abundance increased 2 to 8 times across the three MPA sites. However, live hard coral cover showed a parallel ∼40% decrease across all sites, which can be attributed to several factors. The conservation goals of these MPAs have been attained.

69,One size does not fit all: Critical insights for effective community-based resource management in Melanesia,"In recent years, Fiji's approach of combining traditional systems of community-based coastal management and modern management systems has become a successful blueprint for marine conservation, particularly the Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) network model. As a result of this success, conservation practitioners have imported the Fiji LMMA model to the Solomon Islands and in Vanuatu in hope of replicating the purported success attained in Fiji. This paper argues that because tenure systems and associated political systems in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are substantially different, one cannot simply extrapolate the more centralized tenurial and political Fiji model to the decentralized tenurial and politically eclectic Solomons and Vanuatu. This paper provides an analysis of some of the various approaches used in these countries to make a case for why socio-political diversity and historical particulars matter to resource management and conservation-in-practice (and for any development interventions). By examining examples of various nested and polycentric governance approaches—family, community, tribal, confederations, local community-based organizations (CBOs), and Church—it elucidates not only some of the differences between Fiji and Solomon Islands/Vanuatu, but also between Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. This provides critical insights into some of the myriad of factors impinging on conservation aspirations in these countries and may offer some alternative ways forward not currently considered by conservation practitioners. Finally, the paper provides some guidelines to how to increase the long-term success of marine conservation programs for fisheries management and community-based management initiatives in the region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",No,No,The abstract does not meet the screening criteria as it does not include a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The abstract does not mention a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.

70,Techno-economic analysis of solar photovoltaic system for fishery cold storage based on ownership models and regulatory boundaries in indonesia,"With Indonesia’s marine resources abundance, it is appropriate for Indonesia’s economic growth to gear towards the fisheries sector. Fishery management in Indonesia is still not operating optimally due to a lack of fisheries management infrastructure. This study took place at the Fish Auction Place in Dadap Village, West Java, Indonesia. The actual problem is a fluctuation in fish catch due to seasonal factors that cause instability in fish prices and fishermen’s incomes. Furthermore, there is no cold storage for storing fish when the fish are abundant so that the quality of the fish will decrease. However, fishery cold storage is energy-intensive equipment, and there is a lack of electricity infrastructure in that coastal area. Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are the key for rural electricity because RES prices are lower, especially on-grid solar photovoltaic (PV), than fossil fuel-based. Consequently, the application of solar PV in Indonesia is still not optimal due to limited regulations. Regulations that hinder the economic value of On-grid PV system are the excess energy compensation percentage and the inverter capacity limitation. Therefore, in this study, we have modelled six regulatory scenarios related to On-grid PV system. The scenarios are how the current 65% excess energy compensation is changed to 85% and 100% (1:1 ratio) and remove the regulation regarding inverter capacity limitation. Furthermore, the ownership model of cold storage is also considered by dividing it into two models, which are commercial-based and community-based. These ownership models have different financial instruments. The simulation gives a new result by changing regulation assumptions that On-grid PV system has a lower Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) than existing regulation because it can produce threefold more electricity to the utility grid with higher inverter capacity. Furthermore, the community-based cold storage rental price can be 16 % cheaper on average with all energy system topologies than the commercial-based ownership model. Then, by reducing the capital costs of solar modules and batteries in 2030, solar PV system’s LCOE will be lower by an average of 20%. It will result in an average reduction of 10% on cold storage rental prices. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the energy system is also conducted in this study. The result is that On-grid PV system is the most secure energy source against price fluctuations. © 2021 by the authors.

72,Characteristics of successful asthma programs,"Objective. We identified characteristics of interventions associated with positive asthma outcomes to understand how programs can be improved. Methods. We identified asthma interventions from the peer-reviewed literature or through a nomination process for unpublished programs. Initially, we identified 532 interventions. Of those, 223 met our eligibility criteria (e.g., focus on asthma, completed an evaluation, and demonstrated at least one asthmarelated health outcome) and provided information on program components and processes, administration, evaluation, and findings through telephone interviews, program documents, and published reports. We analyzed bivariate relationships between programmatic factors and outcomes using Chi-square statistics, Fisher's exact tests, and unconditional logistic regression. We confirmed findings for all programs by analyzing the subset with published results in peer-reviewed journals. Results. Our findings indicated that programs were more likely to report a positive impact on health outcomes if they (1) were community based, (2) engaged the participation of community-based organizations, (3) provided program components in a clinical setting, (4) provided asthma training to health-care providers, (5) collaborated with other organizations and institutions and with government agencies, (6) designed a program for a specific racial/ ethnic group, (7) tailored content or delivery based on individual health or educational needs, and (8) conducted environmental assessments and tailored interventions based on these assessments.

73,"Mangrove forests in Sri Lanka: An updated review on distribution, diversity, current state of research and future perspectives","Mangrove forests, which are well known for coastal protection and carbon sequestration, are a very productive ecosystem found in estuarine and coastal areas in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This study reviews the current status of mangrove ecology, management and conservation in Sri Lanka. In 2015, Sri Lanka became the first nation to legally protect all its mangrove forests; hence mangrove management in Sri Lanka may act as an important exemplar for other nations. Mangroves are found sporadically in the coastal area of Sri Lanka, including as a few dense mangrove forests. Mangrove vegetation provides a cost-effective ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction capability in Sri Lanka, particularly in the areas with poor living standards. Mangroves are used for timber, fishing materials, medicine and food in the country. Despite the environmental and socioeconomic importance of mangroves, several threats, including the expansion of aquaculture and agriculture, urbanization, pollution, climate change and sea level rise, exist in Sri Lanka. Many mangrove reforestation and afforestation initiatives in Sri Lanka have not succeeded, often because of the lack of sufficient monitoring of seedlings after the reforestation campaign and poor selection of planting sites without proper assessment of environmental conditions. In order to protect mangrove forests in Sri Lanka, some immediate measures need to be implemented.

74,"Ten years of Inuit co-management: advancing research, resilience, and capacity in Nunatsiavut through fishery governance","Community-based approaches have risen to prominence in fisheries governance as decision makers have recognized the importance of local perspectives, and Indigenous Peoples have pursued their right to self-determination. In Canada, some Indigenous Peoples have pursued a formalized approach to co-management through land claim agreements. The Torngat Joint Fisheries Board (TJFB) is one such co-management arrangement that focuses on fisheries management in Nunatsiavut, a land claim area in northern Labrador, Canada. This research examines how the TJFB’s work contributes to fisheries governance in the region, and subsequently, how co-management is placed in terms of supporting greater self-determination for Indigenous peoples in resource governance. To understand the TJFB’s role, this research examined 12 years of recorded meeting minutes from 2010 to 2021, highlighting the activities in which the TJFB engages, and how those activities have changed over time. Inductive content analysis was used to understand the activities undertaken by the TJFB, highlighting their actions as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the co-management board in practice. The analysis found that the TJFB plays important roles in research, drafting recommendations, and public education, and that their activities support greater participation from fisheries stakeholders. Land claim–based co-management has a significant impact on how Indigenous sovereignty operates and how it will evolve into the future. The TJFB’s efforts to increase research capacity in the region, push focus towards the socio-cultural dimensions of fisheries management, and strengthen the political voice of the region represent an important move toward self-determination in Nunatsiavut’s commercial fisheries. © 2022, The Author(s).",No,No,The study does not meet the screening criteria as it does not include a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The abstract does not mention any Pacific Island country.

76,A Review of Factors Influencing the Seagrass-Sea Cucumber Association in Tropical Seagrass Meadows,"In the tropical ecosystem, sea cucumbers are associated with seagrass meadows in various ways, often forming a network of ecological interactions. From this myriad of interactions, the trophic relationship between the seagrasses and sea cucumbers has received recent attention with the advent of analytical techniques. However, little is understood about the exact mechanism by which seagrasses are sustaining the sea cucumber populations in the food chain, considering the high number of refractory components in seagrasses and the lack of digestive enzymes among sea cucumbers. This manuscript aims to review existing concepts in ecology concerning the association between tropical seagrasses and sea cucumbers to provide directions for research and management of this vital resource. We searched literature from electronic databases and identified key concepts concerning sea cucumber and seagrass communities based on geographic distribution, nutrient compositions, seagrass decomposition process, and trophic enrichments in the food chain. A conceptual model was then developed detailing the factors influencing the association between the seagrass meadows and sea cucumbers. Despite the limited published information on the seagrass–sea cucumber association, a synthesis of the current understanding of this topic is provided to address the declining sea cucumber populations in the tropical seagrass meadows. We suggest that the successful restoration of sea cucumber fisheries requires a thorough understanding of the seagrass decomposition process, which is vital to the diet of sea cucumbers.

77,Recommendations for the management of subsistence fisheries in South Africa,"This paper summarizes recommendations for the management of previously marginalized and neglected subsistence fisheries in South Africa. The recommendations stem from the activities and analyses of a task group appointed by Government and mandated to provide advice about management of the new fishing sector. The following focus areas were identified for attention: planning for implementation; definitions of subsistence fishers and other sectors; assessment and categorization of resources; determination of types of fishing activities; zonation; management systems; training; communication mechanisms; application and allocation procedures; compliance processes; research and monitoring; development of institutional capacity. Subsistence fishers were defined as poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet basic needs of food security. A second group of informal fishers was identified that fishes for profit but cannot be equated to large industrial fisheries, and a new sector was proposed to accommodate these artisanal ""small-scale commercial"" fishers. Resources were classified for use by these different sectors based on accessibility, fishing methods, cash value and sustainability. In all, 12 different categories of subsistence and small-scale commercial fisheries were identified, and a preliminary list of resource species suitable for different fishing sectors is presented. A multi-tiered institutional management structure is recommended, with the national agency (MCM) controlling issues of national concern, and supporting and coordinating the activities of provincial and local structures. The management agents required for effective implementation were identified and include a dedicated national Subsistence Fisheries Management Unit, provincial management agencies that have the capacity to be delegated authority, Regional Fieldworkers, an independent Advisory Group for Subsistence Fisheries Management, local co-management structures, and community monitors responsible for observing and recording fishing activities and catches: Co-management, involving both authorities and users in joint management; is advocated in preference to previous top-down approaches, because of its potential to improve communication and compliance.",No,No,The study does not meet the screening criteria as there is no case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; There is no mention of a Pacific Island country or CBFM in the Title or Abstract.

79,Introduction: Amazon fisheries,"Twelve years ago, a session on aquatic resources was organized during the first várzea conference. The articles presented in this session focused exclusively on fish resources, and analyses were based on only two study areas. The potential of community-based management for sustainable use of aquatic resources dominated the discussions. Twelve years later, the second várzea conference organized a similar session on aquatic resources. Some resemblances between the sessions could be noted, including familiar authors, research areas, and topics. The differences, however, are worth noting, among them the inclusion of floodplain resources other than fish. Community-based management again dominated the discussion but the second conference featured more critical analysis of its potential and limitations since after years of practical experience, several initiatives are evaluated. In general the chapters in this section show that significant progress in theory, methods, and practice was achieved in the last decade. Several issues remain to be better explored, including monitoring problems, and the availability of very limited data on co-management processes for making policy decisions. Scale also remains an issue, as do a series of land tenure issues. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

80,The role of taboos in the protection and recovery of sea turtles,"Despite increased efforts from government agencies, scientists, and non-government organizations over the past few decades, anthropogenic sources of sea turtle mortality continue to threaten the survivorship of sea turtle species around the globe. More recent efforts to engage local people with community-based sea turtle conservation programs have been based primarily on economic incentives and less on cultural and social traditions. But there is growing evidence that informal institutions such as, taboos can be extremely effective at promoting wildlife conservation. Ghana is a culturally diverse country where local traditions have shown to improve protection for primates, crocodiles, and many bird species. This study explores the presence of a sea turtle taboo in fishing communities to demonstrate that traditional practices make residents more receptive to sea turtle conservation and more willing to follow government regulations. Fishers in the communities that are aware of the taboo are also more willing to adjust fishing methods to better protect sea turtles. The traditional taboo and national laws appear to be working synergistically to enhance sea turtle conservation in some regions of Ghana. This paper extends the argument that sea turtle conservation strategies succeed when the cultural and social traditions of local communities are integrated with management activities. © 2017 Alexander, Agyekumhene and Allman.",No,No,The paper does not meet the SC as it does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The paper does not mention any Pacific Island country.

81,Politics of marine conservation area in Indonesia: From a centralised to a decentralised system,"This paper aims to analyse the current situation resulting from the Marine Conservation Area (MCA) in Indonesia in terms of the legal framework, institutional conflicts and the response of the local people. A case study of the centralised and decentralised MCA in West Lombok is presented, and the process of establishing the MCA and its institutional performance are reviewed. The performance of centralised system is still questioned because this system marginalises the local people that leads to the rise of conflict and eventually weakens the institution of MCA. Therefore, strengthening decentralised system is necessary to increase the sense of stewardship of the local people over the resources, and to shape a new paradigm of the relationship of poor people-environment and conservation-fisheries, so marginalisation of the local people can be avoided and finally a robust institution can be created. Nevertheless, the case of Awig-awig as a type of community-based coral reef management in Gili Indah shows that decentralised system does not assure achievement of more robust institutional performance. This means that the success of decentralisation is not taken for granted, but there is prerequisite to be considered. At the community level, the prerequisite is a creation of better institutional arrangement including increasing equitability among resource users, a better representation system during process of consensus building and a well-defined property right system. Furthermore, the improvement of legal framework in national level is necessary to create more harmonious legal products related to the marine conservation with emphasis on how to recognise and enhance capacity of the local institution, which may belong to the local government or the local people, in the marine conservation. Thus, community-based management or co-management system can be officially recognised and promoted. In addition, the decentralisation of marine conservation also requires the local governments to have adequate capacity building includes the following aspects: administration skill, political savvy, adaptability and expertise skill.

82,"Environmental awareness and biodiversity conservation among resettled communal farmers in Gwayi Valley Conservation Area, Zimbabwe","This study was conducted in Gwayi Valley Conservation Area in Zimbabwe. The objective was to evaluate the level of environmental awareness raising among rural communities resettled by government in a wildlife conservation area and their behavior and actions towards biodiversity conservation. We selected three communities based on the degree of exposure to environmental awareness campaigns by various government departments and non-governmental organizations. This formed a gradient of exposure to environmental awareness campaigns, ranging from the most accessible and exposed community (Hangano), moderately exposed (Gwayi) through to the least accessible and exposed community (Karna). We used focus group discussions, key informant interviews and structured interviews with 95 respondents in the selected communities from November 2016 to April 2017. Through public awareness raising, a number of conservation groups were established including fire and hunting committees, anti-poaching teams and environmental resource monitors. While these groups were found to be either inactive or less effective in Gwayi and Karna, all were found to be very active and effective in Hangano. Similarly, community behavior and actions that caused biodiversity loss such as indiscriminate cutting of live trees, poaching, streambank cultivation, fishing in rivers with nets and use of sledges were much reduced in Hangano than in Gwayi and Karna. Frequent environmental awareness campaigns played a critical role in promoting biodiversity in Hangano.

83,"Institutional restructuring of fisheries management system for humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus R PPELL 1835) in Anambas and Natuna, Riau Archipelago Province, Indonesia","This policy analysis paper revisits the existing traditional institutions concerned with Humphead wrasse management in Anambas and Natuna, Riau Archipelago Province. It provides an analysis and synthesis of policies that could give direction to the formation and/or strengthening of existing institutions for the benefit of this endangered fish species and all concerned parties. Local community's active involvement and participation is key to the sustainable development of fisheries resources. However, the local community's economic empowerment would be impossible to achieve without institutional strengthening. The paper recommends that community-based institutional empowerment or the ""group approach""should be considered in Anambas and Natuna's fisheries management system for Humphead wrasse.

84,"Questioning community based coral reef management systems: Case study of awig-awig in Gili Indah, Indonesia","Issues and complexities arising when the fisheries and marine tourism sectors have stakes in an institution governing the coral reefs ecosystem called awig-awig are discussed, awig-awig is a colloquialism meaning 'a local rule'. The community-based management system is commonly recognized as a better approach to governing resources, however, the success of awig-awig in the study area is questionable. Awig-awig fails to deal with the conflict of interest among stakeholders in coastal resource appropriation, despite the community being relatively culturally homogenous. The benefits of awig-awig are biased in favor of the tourism as opposed to fisheries, leading to the fishers' resistance of awig-awig. There are critical factors to this weakness: a crisis of legitimacy within community, socio-economic inequality among actors involved in such system, high intervention from external agencies, and the institutional conflict over conservation policy. In addition, awig-awig reduces community spirit as it is perceived as not being attached to any customary law or traditional norms.

85,Releases of cultured sub-adult Trochus niloticus generate broodstock for fishery replenishment in Vanuatu,"The over-fished topshell Trochus niloticus ('trochus') was cultured in Vanuatu and grown to sub-adult size (∼40mm) in sea cages. We released 200 of these trochus at each of five reef sites managed through Customary Marine Tenure (CMT) to test the utility of this approach for restocking. The trochus were individually tagged, measured and placed into crevices behind the reef crest. Searches at the sites after 6 months yielded conservative recapture estimates of 36-47% of tagged individuals at sites. Average growth rates were >2.3mm per month, allowing the trochus to reach shell sizes of 50-60mm, known to be the onset of sexual maturity. Small, yet significant differences in growth rates between release sites (P<0.001) suggest that this restocking approach could be optimised if the ecological correlates to growth rates are identified.

87,Cultural influences on safety and health education among Vietnamese fishermen,"Every ethnic group has its own cultural background and history that influences how it views health behaviors. By virtue of their work history, many Vietnamese have pursued the fishing industry when migrating to the United States. Even though the fishing trades are among the most dangerous jobs in the world, there has been little attention in the literature to the significant role that culture plays in the expression and experience of occupational health practices among Vietnamese shrimp fishermen. Three focus group sessions were conducted to identify factors that hinder or facilitate receptivity to available training and to guide culturally appropriate content. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling among various Vietnamese shrimp fishermen communities in Texas. Utilizing a series of open-ended questions, sessions were conducted in their native language among owners/ captains/deckhands; support infrastructure-adult family members and religious/community leaders; and industry management and insurance representatives. Translations of transcribed documents were compared with simultaneous translations to ensure thematic consistency. Conducting hands-on training among Vietnamese by experienced fishermen, specifically targeting captains, was considered key to safety culture on the vessels. Findings of the study support that training should occur in a variety of formats (hands-on), but should be periodic, current, practical, convenient, taught in the primarylanguage of the audience by an experienced individual, culminate in a certificate of completion, and target captains first.

88,Climate variability and massive mortalities challenge giant clam conservation and management efforts in French Polynesia atolls,"In 2004, the first no-take area (NTA) dedicated to the conservation of giant clams Tridacna maxima was implemented in Tatakoto Atoll, French Polynesia. This NTA protected a unique area worldwide, with extraordinarily high giant clam densities (up to 337 individuals per m2 on 20-m transect). In 2012, a stock assessment survey revealed a dramatic decrease of the clam population. The reduced densities peaked at 38indm-2 and the stock in the NTA decreased from 20.1±6.0million to 1.9±0.55million clams (mean±95% confidence interval). Losses of similar proportions were observed throughout the atoll. Remarkably, the 83% overall loss of this natural resource used daily for consumption and for exports of clam meat to Tahiti Island went unnoticed by the local population. Field clues, including the size of live juveniles attached to the inside of dead shells, pointed to a massive mortality occurring about 3years before the 2012 survey. Examinations of sea surface temperature satellite data identified a high range of temperature variations before March 2009. In agreement with past and recent events in other atolls, this anomaly is the most likely explanation of the massive loss of giant clams in Tatakoto Atoll, although the exact hydrological and biological secondary mechanisms that occurred in the lagoon remain unclear. The consequences of the massive die-off inside and outside the NTA require new long-term management strategies, by reinforcing the top-down national giant clam management arrangements and by setting flexible management objectives across a network of islands. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",No,No,The study does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The article does not mention CBFM, community-based forest management, at all.

89,Effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas in the Philippines for Biodiversity Conservation [Efectividad de las Áreas Marinas Protegidas en las Filipinas para la Conservación de Biodiversidad],"Quantifying the extent to which existing reserves meet conservation objectives and identifying gaps in coverage are vital to developing systematic protected-area networks. Despite widespread recognition of the Philippines as a global priority for marine conservation, limited work has been undertaken to evaluate the conservation effectiveness of existing marine protected areas (MPAs). Targets for MPA coverage in the Philippines have been specified in the 1998 Fisheries Code legislation, which calls for 15% of coastal municipal waters (within 15 km of the coastline) to be protected within no-take MPAs, and the Philippine Marine Sanctuary Strategy (2004), which aims to protect 10% of coral reef area in no-take MPAs by 2020. We used a newly compiled database of nearly 1000 MPAs to measure progress toward these targets. We evaluated conservation effectiveness of MPAs in two ways. First, we determined the degree to which marine bioregions and conservation priority areas are represented within existing MPAs. Second, we assessed the size and spacing patterns of reserves in terms of best-practice recommendations. We found that the current extent and distribution of MPAs does not adequately represent biodiversity. At present just 0.5% of municipal waters and 2.7-3.4% of coral reef area in the Philippines are protected in no-take MPAs. Moreover, 85% of no-take area is in just two sites; 90% of MPAs are &lt;1 km2.

90,"Using a participatory impact assessment framework to evaluate a community-led mangrove and fisheries conservation approach in West Kalimantan, Indonesia","Community-based conservation has been identified as a solution to biodiversity loss, climate change and the reduction of rural poverty. The heterogeneity in social and economic inequalities often acts as a barrier to community engagement in resource management and further inhibits the distributional equity of social and ecological outcomes. This study presents a participatory impact assessment (PIA) framework that evaluated the outcomes of a cross-sector community-led conservation initiative. Community members involved in the programme identified activities and outcomes for the conservation cooperative (CC), ranking the influence of the former on the latter as well as their daily life through multiple focus group discussions (FGDs). Participants were asked to rank the impact of activities on outcomes and the scale of the outcome which was totalled to identify the most impactful programme activities and outcomes during the project period. Community members reported improved income, health, education and the creation of a locally led natural resource management system. Members also reported improved crab harvest rates and reduced mangrove deforestation. Environmental outcomes identified by community members through the PIA were verified through a secondary spatial analysis and mud crab independent fisheries monitoring. The results support the hypothesis that environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) need to consider a multi-dimensional view of human well-being, and that cross-sector integrated interventions may be effective at improving multiple outcomes. Future steps should focus on spatial replication of the CC programme which will provide further insights by testing for differences in outcomes between villages, how those are impacted by pre-existing social and ecological systems and comparing outcomes between control sites that did not receive interventions.

91,Developing locally managed marine areas: Lessons learnt from Kenya,"Coastal communities in Kenya are increasingly adopting Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) and by 2015, 24 had been established. Coastal communities perceive the objectives of these LMMAs are to primarily conserve fisheries and marine resources and secure alternative sources of income. In this study we examined if there are generic approaches in how these LMMAs were established, that can be used for developing national guidelines as well as have application to other locations in the western Indian Ocean region. The study involved a literature review of all documents available on the LMMAs and key informant interviews. We found LMMAs in Kenya go through five phases to become fully established and operational: i) Conceptualisation, ii) Inception, iii) Implementation, iv) Monitoring and management; and v) Ongoing Adaptive Management. We defined each stage by the activities that are taking place which determine how far a LMMA has reached in its development. The final phase is when a LMMA exists sustainably in a continuous learning process. Out of 19 LMMAs assessed, four had reached the fifth stage of ‘Ongoing Adaptive Management’ though not all elements of this stage were fully operational. The Kenyan model differs from the widely known Pacific model of four phases due to an additional initial ‘Conceptualisation’ phase. Our results illustrate the need for full acceptance of the LMMA concept by stakeholders before progressing to the ‘Inception phase.’ When this step was missed many LMMAs stalled due to unaddressed training needs, incomplete involvement of stakeholders and lack of financial resources, management and operational structures. These five phases provide a useful guide for communities and other stakeholders to follow when developing LMMAs, or for those that are established and need guidance on their operations. Common factors that we found associated with the development of LMMAs were informed and committed community members, past training in community based marine resource management, a supportive legal framework, external funding and opportunities for sharing LMMA information. The occurrence of an exchange visit to an existing LMMA was invariably the trigger for a community to establish their own LMMA. Weaknesses were seen in poor enforcement on the water and inadequate ongoing education and training. Further there was very little understanding of the costs of establishing and running a LMMA, therefore long term financial sustainability was problematic. Thus, although the rapid increase in the number of LMMAs in Kenya is a conservation success, their effectiveness will be thwarted if enforcement and financial management are not addressed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",No,No,The paper does not include any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The paper does not mention any case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.

92,"Comparison of strategies to increase HIV testing among African-American gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in Washington, DC","This paper presents results from a study conducted to compare the relative effectiveness of three strategies - alternate venue testing (AVT), the social network strategy (SNS), and partner counseling and referral services (PCRS; standard care) - for reaching and motivating previously undiagnosed, African-American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) to be tested for HIV. Data were collected between June 2008 and February 2010 at a gay-identified, community-based organization (CBO) serving AA MSM in Washington, DC. Men were eligible to participate if they were 18-64 years old, self-identified as black or African-American, were biologically male, and self-reported oral or anal sex with a man in the past six months. Fisher's exact test of independence was used to assess differences in demographics, testing history, HIV status and sexual behaviors across the three strategies. The final sample included 470 men who met all eligibility requirements. There were no statistically significant differences in HIV positivity rates across the three strategies. However, relative to standard care, the SNS, and (to a lesser degree) the AVT strategies were more successful in recruiting men that had never been tested. Additionally, the results indicate that each strategy recruited different subgroups of men. Specifically, heterosexually identified men and men who reported engaging in unprotected sex were most likely to be recruited via SNS. Bisexually identified men and older men were most likely to be recruited via AVT or SNS, while standard care tended to reach greater proportions of young men and homosexually identified men. These findings suggest that a combination of strategies may be the best approach for engaging African-American MSM in HIV testing. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",No,No,The paper does not meet the screening criteria as it does not include a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The paper does not mention anything about CBFM in a Pacific Island country.

93,The challenges of local governance: Gear-based fragmentation in the Dominican fishery of Buen Hombre,"The Dominican fishing community of Buen Hombre is struggling to reconcile its fishing activities with the state of the coral reef ecosystem on which it depends. The ecosystem is showing signs of deterioration, and this seems to be resulting in large part because of the fishing activities of the Buen Hombre fishermen. The institutional arrangements of the fishermen themselves, and of relevant external organizations, have not kept pace with important technological and demographic changes that have affected the community. This paper presents the results of an analysis that unpacks these processes via a statistical analysis of fishermen behavior and a social network analysis of the "" cofishing"" network that these fishermen constitute. The statistical analysis shows that gear choice is very important in explaining the amount of fish caught, both as a direct factor and as a mediator of other factors such as membership in the local fishermen's association. The social network analysis complements this result by demonstrating that gear choice also serves to segment the fishermen into separate groups, with few direct linkages between them. The resulting gear-based fragmentation of the community is seen to have negative implications for the ability of the fishermen to act collectively to conserve their fishery. The paper concludes with some thoughts and suggestions for how the community might move forward, including expanding the membership of the fishermen's association and strengthening ties between fishing groups as well as ties between the community and relevant governmental agencies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",No,No,The paper does not meet the SC as it does not include a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The paper is about the challenges of local governance and fishing activities in Buen Hombre, a fishing community in the Dominican Republic.

94,"Whitefish fisheries in mountainous southeastern Norway: Abundant resources, but scarce fisherman","Commercial utilization of inland fish resources can constitute an important addition to other economic activities in rural communities. Based on a case study of commercial whitefish fishery in Lake Femund, a mountain lake in southeastern Norway, this article outlines experience gained and indicates some of the general problems related to this type of economic activity. They concern aspects such as resource biology, product development and marketing, economic management, and staff recruitment. An initial hypothesis of the study was that commercial fishery would have a significant impact on the whitefish stock, causing fluctuations in yield and consequent variations in the economy of the fishery. Therefore, the study included an analysis of marketing possibilities for whitefish products, as well as of the social and socioeconomic conditions sustaining whitefish fishery in the local community. Nearly 20 years of data show that commercial fishery in Lake Femund, with a yield of up to 1 kg per ha, has a low to moderate exploitation rate. Thus, fishery itself does not generate fluctuations in the fish population that would influence yields. The major restrictions on the enterprise are related to other aspects, such as problems of economic and technical management of this specialized small-scale industry, difficulties in the recruitment of fishermen to a short-season fishery in a time when the employment pattern in the community is changing from seasonal activities in agriculture to full-time employment in manufacturing and services, and the challenge of developing and marketing competitive products for a niche market.",No,No,The paper does not meet the SC as it does not include a case study of CBFM in a Pacific Island country.," No; The abstract does not mention any Pacific Island country or CBFM.

95,Estimating willingness to pay with the stochastic payment card design: Further evidence from rural Cameroon,"This study reports new empirical findings of the field test of the stochastic payment card (SPC) design recently proposed by Wang (Contingent valuation of environmental resources: A stochastic perspective, 1997a; Journal of Environmental Economics & Management 32:219-232, 1997b). The purpose is to see how well this new contingent valuation method (CVM) elicitation format works in different cultural contexts, and what lessons can be drawn in general regarding its usefulness in environmental valuation. The survey is designed to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) values for an intended community-based environmental project in rural Cameroon (i.e., the control of malaria using larvivorous eating fish species).

96,Artisanal Fisher Association Leaders’ Estimates of Poaching in Their Exclusive Access Management Areas,"In marine environments, poaching can become a key threat to marine ecosystem conservation. Poaching can occur in marine protected areas and/or in fishery management areas. Unfortunately, understanding the magnitude and characteristics of poaching under community based and co-management governance schemes in coastal and marine environments, has not received the attention it deserves. In Chile, a system of Territorial Users Rights for Fisheries (TURF) has been recognized as one of the largest experiences of small-scale fisheries co-management at a global scale. Currently, poaching is one of the main threats to the TURF system in Chile. In this article, we assessed poaching of a highly valuable benthic resource (Concholepas concholepas) from TURF management areas. We estimated artisanal fisher association leaders’ perceptions of poaching within their TURFs and explore determinants of poaching for Concholepas concholepas. Poaching of Concholepas concholepas showed differences along the studied sites. As expected, the greater abundance of Concholepas concholepas in the management areas generates an increased incentive to poach. Areas that make the greatest investment in surveillance are those most affected by poaching. However, our study cannot determine the effectiveness of current levels of surveillance on illegal extraction. Results show older areas tend to reduce the levels of illegal extraction, which could indicate a greater capacity and experience to control poaching. Supporting fisher associations in enforcing TURFs and following up on sanctions against perpetrators are conditioning factors, highlighted by fisher leaders, for TURF sustainability. The approach used in this study provides insights to prioritize geographies and opportunities to address poaching in small-scale co-managed fisheries.

98,Livelihoods and fisheries governance in a contemporary Pacific Island setting,"Inshore marine resources play an important role in the livelihoods of Pacific Island coastal communities. However, such reliance can be detrimental to inshore marine ecosystems. Understanding the livelihoods of coastal communities is important for devising relevant and effective fisheries management strategies. Semi-structured household interviews were conducted with householders in Langalanga Lagoon, Solomon Islands, to understand household livelihoods and resource governance in fishing-dependent communities. Households were engaged in a diverse range of livelihoods. Fishing, shell money production and gardening were the most important livelihoods. Proximity to an urban centre influenced how households accessed some livelihoods. Perceptions of management rules varied and different reasons were cited for why rules were broken, the most common reason being to meet livelihood needs. Current models of inshore small-scale fisheries management that are based on the notion of community-based resource management may not work in locations where customary management systems are weak and livelihoods are heavily reliant on marine resources. An important step for fisheries management in such locations should include elucidating community priorities through participatory development planning, taking into consideration livelihoods as well as governance and development aspirations. © 2015 Sulu et al.

99,Translating systems thinking into practice for community action on childhood obesity,"We report on the first 18 months of two communities' efforts using methods inspired by community-based participatory system dynamics for the development, implementation, and evaluation of whole of community efforts to improve the health of children. We apply Foster-Fishman's theoretical framework for characterizing systems change to describe the initiatives. Bounding the system began with defining leaders more broadly than standard health interventions to be those who had the ability to change environments to improve health, including food retailers, government, and business, and using high-quality childhood monitoring data to define the problem. Widespread access to junk food, barriers to physical activity, and efforts to promote health predominantly through programmatic approaches were identified as potential root causes. System interactions existed in the form of relationships between stakeholder groups and organizations. The approach described built new relationships and strengthened existing relationships. Willingness in taking risks, changing existing practice, and redesigning health promotion work to have a community development focus, were levers for change. This approach has resulted in hundreds of community-led actions focused on changing norms and environments.
