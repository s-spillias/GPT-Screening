Socio-economic impacts of shrimp culture,"Farmed shrimp contributed 27% of total world shrimp production in 1995 with a volume of 712 000 tonnes. Undoubtedly, the shrimp culture industry earns valuable foreign exchange for developing countries and generates jobs across the industry from fry gatherers to growers and processors. However, grave socio-economic consequences - including conversion, expropriation and privatization of mangroves and other lands; salinization of water and soil; decline in food security; marginalization of coastal communities, unemployment and urban migration; and social conflicts - have followed in the wake of shrimp farm development in the Philippines and other tropical countries. The paper focuses on mangrove ecosystems: the valuation and cost-benefit analysis of their goods and services, and the mangrove-offshore fisheries connection. Research gaps in these areas and the need to internalize the ecological and socio-economic costs ('externalities') of shrimp farming are highlighted. Other recommendations include mangrove conservation and rehabilitation, enforcement of existing legislation, and introduction of environment-friendly aquaculture within the broader framework of community-based, integrated coastal area management, e.g. the traditional, extensive polyculture ponds in Indonesia.",No,The paper does not appear to include a case study from any of the countries specified in the SC.,"No; The abstract mentions the Philippines and Indonesia, but none of the countries listed in the SC.

Community-based scenario planning: a process for vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning to socialÃ¢â‚¬â€œecological change in coastal communities,"The current and projected impacts of climate change make understanding the environmental and social vulnerability of coastal communities and the planning of adaptations important international goals and national policy initiatives. Yet, coastal communities are concurrently experiencing numerous other social, political, economic, demographic and environmental changes or stressors that also need to be considered and planned for simultaneously to maintain social and environmental sustainability. There are a number of methods and processes that have been used to study vulnerability and identify adaptive response strategies. This paper describes the stages, methods and results of a modified community-based scenario planning process that was used for vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning within the context of multiple interacting stressors in two coastal fishing communities in Thailand. The four stages of community-based scenario planning included: (1) identifying the problem and purpose of scenario planning; (2) exploring the system and types of change; (3) generating possible future scenarios; and (4) proposing and prioritizing adaptations. Results revealed local perspectives on social and environmental change, participant visions for their local community and the environment, and potential actions that will help communities to adapt to the changes that are occurring. Community-based scenario planning proved to have significant potential as an anticipatory action research process for incorporating multiple stressors into vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning. This paper reflects on the process and outcomes to provide insights and suggest changes for future applications of community-based scenario planning that will lead to more effective learning, innovation and action in communities and related socialÃ¢â‚¬â€œecological systems.

Adaptive capacity of marine comanagement: a comparative analysis of the influence of colonial legacies and integrated traditional governance on outcomes in the Pacific,"Integrating traditional institutions into marine resource comanagement has become common across the Pacific. However, these arrangements can link village-based and centralized governance systems in many ways, resulting in new hybridized institutional organizations, operational scales, and governance process. Examining the context-specific social, cultural, and historical processes that shape these programs can reveal how systems for comanagement develop, and how institutional differences influence adaptive capacity. Using analytical tools drawn from critical institutionalism and broad institutional perspectives, we assess how different institutional histories and processes of hybridization informed the adaptive capacity of two comanagement programs in Samoa: the Community-Based Fisheries Management Programme (CBFMP) and the Marine Protected Area (MPA) program. While the programs were embedded in similar cultural and ecological contexts, the MPA program became inactive following the 2009 Pacific tsunami, while the CBFMP endured. In spite of early efforts to involve communities in the MPA programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, the institutional history and organization of the programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s managing agency informed an interpretation of comanagement principles that did not adequately incorporate traditional Samoan institutions for coastal management, reducing its adaptive capacity. In contrast, the CBFMP gained resilience through its fundamental integration with village-based social and political institutions, social norms, and values. This analysis of institutional histories, structures, and program outcomes demonstrates that colonial legacies pose obstacles for successful hybridized governance in the Pacific, while also confirming the valuable contributions integrated traditional institutions can make to improving adaptive capacity.

Social dimensions of local fisheries co-management in the Coral Triangle,"SUMMARY The challenge to manage coastal resources within Asia-Pacific's Coral Triangle has gained global attention. Co-management is promoted as a key strategy to address this challenge. Contemporary community-based co-management often leads to 'hybridization' between local (customary) practices, and science-based management and conservation. However, the form of this hybrid has rarely been critically analysed. This paper presents examples of co-management practices in eastern Indonesia and Solomon Islands, focusing in particular on area closures. In contrast to the temporary closures used before the influx of sustainability discourses, contemporary closures are periodically-harvested but predominantly closed, reflecting attempts to reduce fishing effort and enhance ecological sustainability. When areas are opened, harvests are relatively short and largely triggered by the social and economic needs of particular individuals or whole communities. In all cases, engagement with environmental management interventions has led to more formalized access and use arrangements. The harvesting and management practices observed are influenced by these relatively recent interventions designed to promote sustainability, but also by religious institutions, increasing resource demand, and modernization. This study unpacks some of the contemporary influences, particularly environmental sustainability initiatives, on local management practices, and provides insights for co-management in practice.

Potential contribution of multifunctional mangrove resources and its conservation,"Mangrove forests serve as interfaces between the land and sea. They serve as most productive and good bioindicators of the environmental quality and health of any coastal ecosystem and as long-term carbon sinks for carbon storing or sequestration. Mangroves are seen in 123 tropical and subtropical countries, and 73 species are recognized as Ã¢â‚¬Å“trueÃ¢â‚¬Â mangroves. The world mangrove distribution totals 150, 000 km2, of which Southeast Asia basically covers the highest percentage at 33.5%, followed by South America covering 15.7%, North and Central America at 14.7%, and West and Central Africa 13.2%. In last 25 years a 20% decline has occurred, mainly due to conversion and coastal development, which is three to four times faster than the decline in terrestrial forest. From combating climate change to protecting fisheries and coastlines around the world, mangroves are among the most vital and interconnected of environments. More proportionally than any other type of forest, mangroves sequester up to five times more carbon per hectare than tropical rainforests. Community-based approaches for their restoration and sustainable management are dynamic options for improving the livelihood of mangrove forest ecosystems and reducing their vulnerability.

The codevelopment of coastal fisheries monitoring methods to support local management,"Small-scale fisheries across the globe provide critical food security, livelihoods, and human well-being, but are threatened by a combination of local and global stressors, including overexploitation, pollution, and climate change. Participatory approaches to management, especially those that incorporate local communities and customary knowledge can provide meaningful biological information that supports sustainable fisheries management and builds local adaptive capacity to changing ocean conditions. Through a collaboration between fishers, scientists, NGOs, and regulating agencies, we developed a low-cost, low-tech method to assess the seasonal spawning peaks, lunar spawning cycles, and size at maturity (L50) for key targeted reef fish, combining traditional knowledge and practice with modern scientific approaches, including gonadosomatic index (GSI) and histology. Two years of community-based monitoring resulted in data from 57 species and 15 families of reef and nearshore fishes (n = 2595), with detailed information for 10 species at 4 locations across the Hawaiian Islands. Comparisons between community-collected GSI data and scientifically (histologically) assessed spawning cycles and size at reproductive maturity produced similar results suggesting that these approaches can be applied in data-poor fisheries to assess spawning seasons and size at maturity (L50), both of which are critical needs for effective fisheries management. Semistructured surveys revealed a large body of local knowledge on spawning times and harvest practices based on allowing spawning to occur before harvesting and protecting small and large size classes, but little evidence that fishers understand temporal patterns of spawning. This suggests that monitoring methods that fill key gaps such as this and are congruent with these local knowledge systems and customary harvest practices may be key for local stewardship and adaptive management.

Fisheries science and marine education catalyze the renaissance of traditional management (rahui) to improve an artisanal fishery in French Polynesia,"Coral reef fisheries provide important ecosystem services to coastal communities, yet in the Pacific Islands, many of these contemporary fisheries are threatened by overexploitation. Historically, Pacific Island societies successfully utilized community-based management and spatial temporal closures to regulate the harvest of marine resources. In recognition of their past success these actions are currently being reemployed throughout the region. However, in many communities, innovative approaches may be needed to revitalize such practices and adapt traditional management to contemporary societal needs and expectations. This study presents the case of Anaa Atoll, a remote Pacific Island in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia, and the community's efforts to conserve a culturally important but overexploited bonefish (Albula glossodonta) fishery. Ultimately, fisheries research, education, and the creation of Aire Marine Educative (a marine area that is managed by a local primary school) were successful in building social cohesion and supporting the renaissance of rahui (a traditional form of restricting access to resources and or territories) to manage this fishery. On March 1st, 2019, the community of Anaa reinitiated this tradition for the first time in centuries. Based on these experiences, and an ensuing increase in the Spawning Potential Ratio of the bonefish stock, it is proposed that nationally recognized local management systems that incorporate fisheries research, youth education, and the cultural practices of communities should be supported in the marine policies of the Pacific Islands and beyond.

Research partnerships with local communities: Two case studies from Papua New Guinea and Australia,"Partnerships between scientists and local communities can increase research capacity and data delivery while improving management effectiveness through enhanced community participation. To encourage such collaboration, this study demonstrates how these partnerships can be formed, drawing on two case studies in coral reef ecosystems in very different social settings (Papua New Guinea and Australia).

These included: (1) early engagement by collaborating organizations to build trust, (2) ensuring scientific questions have direct relevance to the community, (3) providing appropriate incentives for participation, and (4) clear and open communication. Community participants engaged in a variety of research activities, including locating and capturing fishes, collecting and recording data (weight, length and sex), applying external tags, and removing otoliths (ear bones) for ageing and elemental analysis.

Community based aquaculture in the western indian ocean: Challenges and opportunities for developing sustainable coastal livelihoods,"The small-fisheries social-ecological system in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) represents a typical social-ecological trap setting where very poor natural resources dependent coastal communities face local and global threats and engage in unsustainable practices of exploiting limited resources. Community-based aquaculture (CBA) has been implemented as an important alternative or supplementary income generating activity for minimizing the overdependence on marine natural resources and promoting biodiversity conservation. Despite its proliferation throughout the WIO region in recent decades, little is known about the degree to which CBA activities have contributed to achieving the objectives of breaking the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation and promoting community development and biodiversity conservation. In order to improve understanding of common challenges and to generate recommendations for best practice, we assessed the most common CBA activities practiced in the region through literature review and workshop discussion involving practitioners and key stakeholders. Findings indicated that despite favorable environmental conditions for various CBA practices, the sector remains underdeveloped, with few activities delivering the intended benefits for coastal livelihoods or conservation. Constraints included a shortage of seed and feed supplies, low investment, limited technical capacity and skills, insufficient political support, and lack of a clear strategy for aquaculture development. These are compounded by a lack of engagement of local stakeholders, with decision making often dominated by donors, development agencies, and private sector partners. Many of the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CBA projects are designed along unrealistically short time frames, driven by donors rather than entrepreneurs, and so are unable to achieve financial sustainability, which limits the opportunity for capacity building and longer-term development. There is little or no monitoring on ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Except for a few isolated cases, links between CBA and marine conservation outcomes have rarely been demonstrated. Realizing the potential of CBA in contributing toward food security in the WIO will necessitate concerted investment and capacity strengthening to overcome these systemic challenges in the sector. Lessons herein offer managers, scientists, and policy advisors guidance on addressing the challenges faced in building strategic development initiatives around aquaculture in developing countries.

Incorporating fishermen's local knowledge and behavior into geographical information systems (GIS) for designing marine protected areas in Oceania,"Drawing on our experience in establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Roviana and Vonavona Lagoons, New Georgia, Solomon Islands, this paper shows how a geographical information system (GIS) database can be used to incorporate socio-spatial information, such as indigenous knowledge and artisanal fishing data, along with biophysical and other information to assist in MPA design. We argue that converting peoples' knowledge and socioecological behavior into geo-spatial data allows researchers to formulate hypotheses regarding human responses to inter- and intra-habitat variability, along with other marine ecological processes, and help in the designing and implementation of resource management strategies in a cost-effective and participatory way, bridging the gap between indigenous and Western cognitions of seascapes.

Life-history characteristics of an exploited bonefish Albula glossodonta population in a remote South Pacific atoll,"Bonefishes Albula spp. are important components of subsistence fisheries and lucrative sport fishing industries throughout their circumtropical distribution. In Oceania, however, Albula spp. have historically been overexploited and there is a growing need to balance the demands of competing fishing sectors, making the description of their life history a regional priority. To this aim, we collected biological samples from Albula spp. of Anaa atoll, French Polynesia, to identify the species that compose the stock and estimate their life-history parameters including age, growth, reproduction and natural mortality. Our results indicate that Albula glossodonta is the species of bonefish present, with a maximum age that is below the, 20 year longevity of the genus (8 years in males and 10 years in females). Differential growth patterns existed between the two sexes (LÃ¢Ë†Å¾ = 58, 78 cm fork length (LF) and K = 0.38, 0.21 for males and females, respectively). Males attained sexual maturity at 43 cm LF (c. 3 years) whereas females matured at 48 cm LF (c. 4 years) and oocyte production was significantly related to body mass, with a maximum batch fecundity of 1,133,767 oocytes in a 4406 g (70 cm LF) female. The gonado-somatic index of harvested fishes indicated that the spawning season extends from March through September. Based on the observation of a, 20 year bonefish at the proximate Tetiaroa Atoll and several empirical models, estimates of natural mortality ranged from 0.21 to 0.68; however, an estimate of 0.21 was deemed most appropriate. This information facilitated the resurgence of a Rahui (temporary fishing closure) and community-based management to protect A. glossodonta during a critical portion of their spawning season and in this context our results provide an important demographic baseline in evaluating the recovery of this fishery.

Rethinking spatial costs and benefits of fisheries in marine conservation,"Fishing catch is often used as a cost in marine conservation planning to avoid areas of high fishing activity when identifying potential marine reserve locations. However, the theory of marine reserves indicates that reserves are more likely to benefit fisheries in areas of heavy fishing activity that would otherwise be overfished. Whether or not fishing catch is calculated as a cost depends on the balance of conservation and fisheries goals for a reserve, and thus is critical for policymakers to consider when designing marine reserve networks. This research shows the utility of running an inverted cost model of fishery catches during marine reserve spatial prioritization as a first step in a marine planning process oriented towards stabilizing local fisheries. This technique serves as a heuristic tool that may help conservation planners explore regions that would otherwise be overlooked if fisheries data were absent or integrated purely as a cost in the planning process. Drawing on data from Madagascar to illustrate our approach, this research demonstrates that the regions most frequently selected using the inverted cost model not only meet conservation targets, but are also those most accessible to community-based resource managers, the dominant management paradigm in Madagascar as well as in many developing countries.

Combined effects of social pressure from the inside and outside of fishing communities promote cooperation for stock management,"We analyze a coupled socioeconomic and bioeconomic dynamics model for fisheries management in a local community. In the model, fishermen choose to cooperate with the fisheries management rule or not at each time step, depending on the utilities of each option. The social dynamics is coupled with the dynamics of the stock biomass. Fishermen's utility basically depends on their catch, and the utility function of the noncooperative option is penalized by a psychological punishment, ""social pressure"", which is affected by both the fraction of cooperative players and stock abundance. We classify social pressure into two categories: pressure originating from the inside and from the outside of the community. We develop a utility function with these social pressures and analyze the coupled dynamics. Our results show that all fishermen can end up cooperating with the management rule if both sources of internal and external social pressure have sufficient effect. The results imply that psychological aspects on fishermen can have an important role for successful management of local fisheries.

"Indigenous knowledge and long-term ecological change: Detection, interpretation, and responses to changing ecological conditions in pacific island communities","When local resource users detect, understand, and respond to environmental change they can more effectively manage environmental resources. This article assesses these abilities among artisanal fishers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. In a comparison of two villages, it documents local resource users' abilities to monitor long-term ecological change occurring to seagrass meadows near their communities, their understandings of the drivers of change, and their conceptualizations of seagrass ecology. Local observations of ecological change are compared with historical aerial photography and IKONOS satellite images that show 56 years of actual changes in seagrass meadows from 1947 to 2003. Results suggest that villagers detect long-term changes in the spatial cover of rapidly expanding seagrass meadows. However, for seagrass meadows that showed no long-term expansion or contraction in spatial cover over one-third of respondents incorrectly assumed changes had occurred. Examples from a community-based management initiative designed around indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure governance show how local observations of ecological change shape marine resource use and practices which, in turn, can increase the management adaptability of indigenous or hybrid governance systems.

Use of monitoring data to support conservation management and policy decisions in Micronesia,"Adaptive management implies a continuous knowledge-based decision-making process in conservation. Yet, the coupling of scientific monitoring and management frameworks remains rare in practice because formal and informal communication pathways are lacking. We examined 4 cases in Micronesia where conservation practitioners are using new knowledge in the form of monitoring data to advance marine conservation. These cases were drawn from projects in Micronesia Challenge jurisdictions that received funding for coupled monitoring-to-management frameworks and encompassed all segments of adaptive management. Monitoring in Helen Reef, Republic of Palau, was catalyzed by coral bleaching and revealed evidence of overfishing that led to increased enforcement and outreach. In Nimpal Channel, Yap, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), monitoring the recovery of marine food resources after customary restrictions were put in place led to new, more effective enforcement approaches. Monitoring in Laolao Bay, Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, was catalyzed by observable sediment loads from poor land-use practices and resulted in actions that reduced land-based threats, particularly littering and illegal burning, and revealed additional threats from overfishing. Pohnpei (FSM) began monitoring after observed declines in grouper spawning aggregations. This data led to adjusting marine conservation area boundaries and implementing market-based size class restrictions. Two themes emerged from these cases. First, in each case monitoring was conducted in a manner relevant to the social and ecological systems and integrated into the decision-making process. Second, conservation practitioners and scientists in these cases integrated culturally appropriate stakeholder engagement throughout all phases of the adaptive management cycle. More broadly, our study suggests, when describing adaptive management, providing more details on how monitoring and management activities are linked at similar spatial scales and across similar time frames can enhance the application of knowledge.

"Communities, knowledge and fisheries of the future","The 'human dimension' in fisheries management has historically been incorporated via a specific economic understanding of fisheries wedded to a single-species approach. Meeting the challenge of fisheries, however, will require a broadening of fisheries science towards an ecosystems-based approach. There is also the need for a parallel shift in social science understandings of fishing towards context and interrelationships amongst and between fishermen and fishing communities. While the move towards ecosystems is well underway, a corresponding movement in fisheries social science is less well established. The latter will require a commitment to new sources of data, methods and forms and scales of analysis. Promising initiatives that align with ecosystem-based approaches include the documentation and incorporation of Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK), cooperative research that bridges communicative and epistemological gaps between fishermen and scientists and community-level data collections and analyses emerging from legislative mandates and community-based advocacy. These examples suggest a reorientation of fisheries social science in step with ecosystem approaches.

Coral reefs: Artisanal fisheries and community-based management,"The nations that make up East Asia incorporate an extensive coastline, and therefore the reliance on marine resources is traditionally high in many regions. While economic development has led to increased livelihood diversification and more commercial fishing, large areas remain heavily reliant on nearshore artisanal fisheries, often to satisfy subsistence lifestyles. The most widespread examples of this are nearshore fisheries surrounding coral reefs, which are found throughout Southeast Asia in particular. When the direct impacts of heavy reliance on these fisheries are combined with ecosystem deterioration and an ever expanding human population, reefassociated fisheries become a global conservation and management priority. This chapter will focus on the status of reef fisheries in Southeast Asia due to their well-recognised status as a priority for fisheries management throughout the region. The following will attempt to summarise the current status of reef fisheries in Southeast Asia as well as levels of reliance on them, before discussing the management options in effect there.

Ten years of dynamic co-management of a multi-species reef fishery,"Co-management, a governance process whereby management responsibility is shared between resource users and other collaborators, is a mainstream approach for governing social and ecological aspects of small-scale fisheries. While many assessments of co-management are available for single time periods, assessments across longer time-scales are rareÃ¢â‚¬â€œmeaning the dynamic nature, and long-term outcomes, of co-management are insufficiently understood. In this study we analyse ten-years of catch and effort data from a co-managed, multi-species reef fishery in Solomon Islands. To further understand social, ecological and management dynamics we also draw on interviews with fishers and managers that had been conducted throughout the same decade. We aimed to answer (1) what are the temporal trends in fishing effort, harvesting efficiency, and catch composition within and beyond a periodically-harvested closure (i.e. a principal and preferred management tool in Pacific island reef fisheries), and, (2) what are the internal and external drivers that acted upon the fishery, and its management. Despite high fishing effort within the periodically-harvested closure, catch per unit effort remained stable throughout the ten years. Yet the taxonomic composition of catch changed substantially as species targeted early in the decade became locally depleted. These observations indicate that both the frequency of harvesting and the volumes harvested may have outpaced the turnover rates of target species. We argue that this reflects a form of hyperstability whereby declining abundance is not apparent through catch per unit effort since it is masked by a shift to alternate species. While the community sustained and adapted their management arrangements over the decade as a response to internal pressures and some signs of resource changes, some external social and ecological drivers were beyond their capabilities to govern. We argue the collaborative, knowledge exchange, and learning aspects of adaptive co-management may need even more attention to deal with this complexity, particularly as local and distal pressures on multi-species fisheries and community governance intensify.

Participatory approaches have been seen as ways to make scarce resources go further, and to make more people more accountable for environmental outcomes. Viability of participatory programmes has been challenged, however, by: increasing social mobility as a result of globalisation, economic development and migration, and the impact of this mobility on the integrity of local social networks and quality of local knowledge; marginalisation of potential participants in sustainable natural resource management from resource access and property rights; and limited capacity of state institutions to develop partnership-based approaches to natural resource management within territories where their influence is tenuous.

Coupling remote sensing with in situ surveys to determine reef fish habitat associations for the design of marine protected areas,"Nearshore fish populations are in decline in the main Hawaiian Islands, and effective, sustainable management is needed. There has been increasing emphasis on the value of ecosystem- based management and the conservation of essential fish habitat, but policy is encumbered by a lack of supporting information. This study uses science and technology to support traditional knowledge in identifying juvenile fish habitats, providing a basis for effective resource management in a rural Hawaiian community. Building on existing local knowledge of nearshore resources, we quantitatively assessed juvenile fish-habitat associations. We conducted fine-scale in situ ecological surveys of juvenile reef fishes and their habitats, and produced detailed benthic habitat maps using GIS and interpretation of satellite imagery, from which we extracted multiscale seascape variables. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess fish-habitat relationships at multiple scales. Depth, coral cover, structural complexity, scattered rock and coral habitat, and distance to shore emerged as primary factors associated with juvenile reef fish abundance. We identified the habitat associations of 2 important food resource species in the study area of Ha2'ena, Kaua'i: The convict tang Acanthurus triostegus sandvicensis, an endemic subspecies, and the redlip parrotfish Scarus rubroviolaceus. Results from this study played an important role in the successful approval of the Ha2'ena community-based fishery management plan by the state governing agency.

From community-based resource management to complex systems: The scale issue and marine commons,"Most research in the area of common and common-pool resources in the past two or three decades sought the simplicity of community-based resource management cases to develop theory. This was done mainly because of the relative ease of observing processes of self-governance in simple cases, but it raises questions related to scale. To what extent can the findings of small-scale, community-based commons be scaled up to generalize about regional and global commons? Even though some of the principles from community-based studies are likely to be relevant across scale, new and different principles may also come into play at different levels. The study of cross-level institutions such as institutions of co-management, provides ways to approach scale-related questions and deal with linkages in complex adaptive systems. Looking beyond self-governance, community-based resource management needs to deal with multiple levels of governance and external drivers of change, as illustrated in this paper with examples of marine commons.

Identifying indicators to evaluate community-managed freshwater protected areas in the lower mekong basin: A review of marine and freshwater examples,"Protected areas are frequently established as a management tool to conserve terrestrial and aquatic habitats and species. Monitoring and evaluation are a necessary part of adaptive management to determine whether such protected areas are effectively meeting their objectives. While numerous initiatives have developed methods to evaluate terrestrial and marine protected areas (MPAs), similar efforts and resources are lacking for freshwater protected areas (FPAs), which have become widespread as a community-based fisheries management approach in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). This review summarizes published literature on the evaluation of marine and freshwater protected areas to provide guidance on the evaluation of community-managed FPAs in the LMB. Specifically, the review examines several indicators related to common objectives of aquatic protected areas and provides considerations for measuring these indicators in the context of community-managed freshwater protected areas in the LMB. Key conclusions include that first, FPAs should be established with clearly defined objectives, and these objectives should inform the selection of indicators for evaluation. Second, indicators identified for MPAs are highly relevant to FPAs, although methods may require adaptation to a freshwater environment. Finally, socioeconomic and governance indicators are overlooked in both MPA and FPA evaluations compared to biophysical indicators, and interdisciplinary assessment teams could ensure these indicators receive adequate consideration.

Here we focus on the forestry and fisheries sectors to answer the question: What is the evidence that the gender composition of forest and fisheries management groups affects resource governance and conservation outcomes? We present a systematic map detailing the geographic and thematic extent of the evidence base and assessing the quality of the evidence, as per a published a priori protocol. Methods: We screened 11,000+ English-language records in Scopus, CAB abstracts, AGRIS, AGRICOLA, Google Scholar, and Google. The websites of 24 international conservation and development organisations, references of included articles, and relevant systematic reviews were also searched for possible documents. A number of groups and individuals were invited to submit documents through email 'call outs'. The inclusion criteria were that an article refers to women or gender, forests or fisheries, and a resource management group comparison in a non-OECD country plus Mexico and Chile. Results: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Four were qualitative and 13 were quantitative. Forest studies outnumbered fisheries studies 14-3. The majority of the studies came from India and Nepal and focused on forest management. All 17 studies identified improvements in local natural resource governance, and three identified conservation improvements when women participated in the management of the resources. Only two studies, however, were rated as high quality based on study design. Conclusions: For India and Nepal, there is strong and clear evidence of the importance of including women in forest management groups for better resource governance and conservation outcomes. Outside of India and Nepal, there are substantial gaps in the evidence base, but the South Asian evidence presents a compelling case for extending the research to other geographies to see if similar outcomes exist elsewhere and supports a theory of change linking the participation of women in forestry and fisheries management groups with better resource governance and conservation outcomes.

Rocking the boat: conserving fisheries and protecting jobs,"Fisheries and the economic and social benefits they offer society are under siege around the globe. Most of the world's marine fish stocks and primary fishing grounds are in decline. Nearly one-third of all fish are thrown back to sea dead or dying each year because of wasteful fishing practices. The food security of more than 1 billion people who rely on fish for much of their anomal protein is also at risk because one of every three fish captured goes to feed animals and other uses. The roots of the crisis run deep. They include the open acess nature of fishing - which draws people; into the industry well after profits and catches begin falling; widespread technological change and fleet growth; and national development policies that promote expansion at the expense of the resource. The industry barely stays afloat, even as billions of dollars in subsidies are poured into it. The author identifies several steps to reverse the precipitous declines in fish stocks while protecting food supplies and jobs. Impelemented sustainability, aquaculture can continue to meet growing demand. Community-based management, marine protected areas, and more selective fishing gear can rehabilitate fish populations and habitats. Efforts to restore market discipline by limiting access and by charging what fish actually cost, combined with consumer education and eco-labelling programs, can also contribute to rescuing today's collapsing fisheries.",No,The abstract does not provide information about a case study from the specified countries.,"No; The abstract does not mention any specific case study from the listed countries.

Sport fisheries: Opportunities and challenges for diversifying coastal livelihoods in the Pacific,"High population growth rates and poverty are likely to elevate the vulnerability of many coastal communities in the Pacific region to climate change. Alternative livelihood strategies which can generate income and simultaneously conserve fish stocks and their habitats are a priority. This paper investigates the feasibility of 'sport fishing' (recreational catch and release angling for particular species of predatory game fish) as such a strategy. The limited research of sport fisheries in developing countries is augmented with a review of community-based ecotourism, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) and common property management literature to propose design principles. Five pre-requisite principles for the success of sport fishery enterprises are suggested. First, adequate local capacity must be available to manage a tourism business and facilities, supported by cross-scale co-management amongst stakeholders. Second, appropriate governance arrangements must be in place to ensure the equitable dispersal of benefits to all members of the local community, and conflict resolution. Third, resource-ownership boundaries and rights must be clearly delineated before the enterprise begins in order to minimise the potential for future conflict. Fourth, social, biodiversity and ecosystem service co-benefits should result from the enterprise. These should include improvements in income, health, education, food security, the status of the target and non-target species and their habitat and non-fishery ecosystem services. Fifth, monitoring and evaluation of these principles is required within an adaptive co-management framework which takes a social-ecological systems approach and includes all stakeholders in social learning and power-sharing. Through this, broader impacts of the enterprise may emerge which go beyond the standard assessment of ecotourism and ICDP success in financial or biodiversity terms. These principles now need to be tested by researching the experiences of case studies of sport fishing enterprises in the Pacific.

Higher fish biomass inside than outside marine protected areas despite typhoon impacts in a complex reefscape,"No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are an important tool for conserving marine biodiversity and managing fisheries. However, with increasing environmental change driven by local and global stressors, it is critical to understand whether MPAs can continue to provide social, economic and conservation benefits in the long-term. Here, we compare coral reef benthic and fish assemblages across 17 paired MPA-fished control sites on three heavily populated, high elevation Ã¢â‚¬Å“mainlandÃ¢â‚¬Â islands, and four lowly populated, low elevation Ã¢â‚¬Å“offshoreÃ¢â‚¬Â islands that differed in their exposure to recent typhoons. Despite lower cover of macroalgae in MPAs compared to fished areas, especially on mainland islands, there were no consistent differences in benthic assemblages or total hard coral cover between paired MPA and fished reefs. Typhoons had severe negative effects on live hard coral cover, regardless of island type or MPA protection, and typhoon impacted reefs supported different fish assemblages and lower total biomass of fish, compared to non-impacted reefs. Although fish assemblage structure and total biomass differed between mainland and offshore islands, MPAs consistently supported a higher total biomass of fish than fished areas, with the magnitude of the MPA effect lower on typhoon impacted reefs. Our findings suggest that despite inherent differences in environmental conditions between mainland and offshore island coral reefs, MPAs can provide benefits to fish biomass, even when reefs are affected by typhoons. The development of management strategies that incorporate sound coastal land-use practices, while positioning MPAs in areas less prone to typhoon impact, will provide MPAs the best chance of success if climatic extremes increase.

Opportunities in community-government cooperation to maintain marine ecosystem services in the Asia-Pacific and Oceania,"Island nations and islands in Oceania and the Asia Pacific rely heavily on coastal and marine ecosystem services. Systems such as coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves are intrinsically important, vital to many people's livelihoods, and in many cases intertwined with cultural systems. Some, such as the reefs of the Coral Triangle, are seriously threatened by fishing pressures, including destructive fishing practices, pollution and environmental change. Governments, and concerned coastal communities, each try to work to protect or manage the exploitation of important ecosystems, yet apart from the limited cases with endorsed systems of co-management or community based management, communities and governments can find themselves working separately and not necessarily in harmony. A participatory diagnosis on the island of Selayar, Eastern Indonesia, highlights opportunities for communities and government to improvement alignment of their efforts towards sustainable management of marine ecosystems. The findings from this study can inform strategies in Oceania and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific towards improved management of marine and coastal ecosystems, from the standpoints of communities, government and civil-society actors.

The role of livelihoods in collective engagement in sustainable integrated coastal management: Oslob Whale Sharks,"Livelihoods are a crucial factor in sustainable integrated coastal management and can bring big payoffs for people and coral reef resources but their role in encouraging collective engagement in management is not well understood. Dive tourism is often cited for its capacity to provide livelihoods to reduce reliance on coral reef resources, however, there is little evidence of its ability to achieve this goal. We use key stakeholder interviews with artisanal fishers, their community, local government and politicians and the sustainable livelihoods framework to study Oslob Whale Sharks, the most financially successful and controversial community based dive tourism site in the world. Oslob Whale Sharks has generated income from ticket sales of approximately US$18.4 m over five years. We found that Oslob Whale Sharks has created alternate livelihoods for 177 fishers, and diversified livelihoods throughout the community, reducing fishing effort and changing livelihood strategies away from reliance on coral reef resources. Livelihoods from Oslob Whale Sharks increase food security for fishers and their families and improve the wellbeing of their community. Livelihoods have galvanised fishers and their community to change behaviour and collectively engage in management. Our findings indicate connection between livelihoods and the provision of finance to protect whale sharks and manage five marine reserves, indicating that fishers and local government are protecting the whale sharks and coral reef resources their livelihoods depend on.

Integrated coastal management in Philippine local governance: Evolution and benefits,"In 1991 the Philippine government shifted many coastal management responsibilities to local governments and fostered increased local participation in the management of coastal resources. In their delivery of integrated coastal management (ICM) as a basic service, many local governments have achieved increasing public awareness of coastal resource management (CRM) issues. Continuing challenges are financial sustainability, inadequate capacities, weak law enforcement, and lack of integrated and collaborative efforts. To address these challenges, a CRM certification system was developed to improve strategies and promote incentives for local governments to support ICM. This system is being applied by an increasing number of local governments to guide the development and implementation of ICM in their jurisdiction. The CRM benchmarks required for a local government to achieve the first level of certification are: budget allocated, CRM related organizations formed and active, CRM plan developed and adopted, shoreline management initiated and two or more best practices implemented. Implementation is providing tangible benefits to communities through enhanced fisheries production associated with MPAs, revenues from user fees and enhanced community pride through learning exchanges and involvement in decisions, among others.",No,"The study is based in the Philippines, not in any of the countries specified in the SC.","No; The paper is focused on the Philippines, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

The assessment 'toolbox': Community-based reef evaluation methods coupled with geochemical techniques to identify sources of stress,"There have been few seminal advances in techniques of health evaluation of coral reefs since line transects and visual fish counting were first proposed in 1972, yet the rate of resource destruction increases rapidly. Especially in Third World settings, coastal communities need access to simple techniques that have been shown to identify stress on reefs: (1) Coral mortality indices, (2) Benthic bioindicators (stomatopods, forams, amphipods), (3) Coral associate counts, and (4) Bioerosion amounts in coral rubble. Coral growth rates are an undependable measure of reef health: corals on dying reefs with low coral cover often exhibit higher than normal growth rates. Transect data may be cast into other forms, such as triangular diagrams, to be more effective in reef management. All of these rapid assessment techniques have been shown to be effective in the hands of persons with limited technical training. Each is rapid and cost-effective. Once one of the 'tools' in the assessment 'toolbox' has detected stress, the precise nature of the source can be identified via geochemical techniques: (1) Sewage: stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (ÃŽÂ´15N) in a number of organisms (stomatopods, corals) are enriched at sites subject to sewage discharge. (2) Siltation: in areas subject to siliciclastic input, insoluble residues in coral skeletons are a measure of exogenous sediment input. (3) Thermal/Light stress: as has been shown in studies of El NiÃƒÂ±o events and the Indonesian 'haze' of 1997, the ÃŽÂ´13C signal in coral skeletons is a measure of metabolic stress caused by changes in light and temperature.",No,The paper does not specify a case study from the listed countries in the title or abstract.,"No; The abstract does not mention any specific location or case study from the listed countries.

Utilization of marine taxa within an artisanal shellcraft sector of the Indo-Pacific region,"Sustainable utilization of marine taxa is critical for maximizing social and economic goals of livelihood development within the Indo-Pacific. Yet, despite an increasing importance of shellcraft as a livelihood activity within the Indo-Pacific, information on the taxa utilized within shellcraft sectors remains scant. To address this knowledge gap, our study examined diversity, in terms of composition and quantities, of marine taxa utilized by artisan households and, collectively, within an artisanal shellcraft sector of Papua New Guinea. For each taxon, critical source habitats were identified, and the geographic scale of exploitation established. Critically, presented data revealed 73 taxa, representing at least 77 species, were utilized within the studied sector. Many of the taxa utilized had not previously been linked to shellcraft sectors, demonstrating that a broader composition of taxa is utilized than previously acknowledged. In terms of quantity, annual utilization within the sector was close to 500,000 individuals, the majority being mollusks of either class Gastropoda (83.6%), represented by 37 genera, or class Bivalvia (9.6%), represented by four genera. There was a strong bias towards a particular species, Chrysostoma paradoxum (78.5% of all individuals), as indicated by indices for the diversity utilized (HÃ¢â‚¬Â² = 1.23; D = 0.38). However, substantial variation was evident in the diversity of taxa utilized among households (n = 36) engaged in shellcraft (HÃ¢â‚¬Â² = 1.09 Ã‚Â± 0.71; D = 0.43 Ã‚Â± 0.27), with each household utilizing a unique composition of 19.1 Ã‚Â± 10.6 taxa. Source habitats for taxa ranged from pelagic to benthic intertidal and subtidal substrates, with the geographic scale of exploitation extending to 34 discrete locations up to 417Ã‚Â km away. The array of sector, household, and taxon-specific information presented provides a basis for supporting greater sustainability within shellcraft sectors across the Indo-Pacific, which is discussed within a context of informing community-based resource management, further developing marine aquaculture, and strengthening existing governance.

"Artisanal shark fishing in the Louisiade Archipelago, Papua New Guinea: Socio-economic characteristics and management options","Small-scale shark fisheries in Papua New Guinea have developed rapidly and are largely unmanaged. While shark species are vulnerable to overexploitation, local fishers who depend on shark fin for income also have limited alternative income options. This implies a difficult trade-off for policy makers between conservation and community welfare. A case study of shark fishing activities in the Louisiade Archipelago of the Milne Bay Province, a major small-scale shark fin producing region, is presented to inform such trade-offs. The region has experienced a significant reduction in available income opportunities due to the recent closure of the local sea cucumber fishery in 2009. While it had been widely assumed that shark fin production and income was likely to have escalated in the region to replace lost sea cucumber income, our model of small-scale shark fin production shows that quarterly dried fin production was in fact, on average, 68Ã‚Â kg higher while the sea cucumber fishery operated (holding all else constant). Furthermore, annual shark fin income is estimated to have fallen by 75% following the sea cucumber fishery closure. Falling prices and a decline in market access resulting from the closure of the sea cucumber fishery appear to be the major drivers of the fall in shark fin production. These factors have been accentuated by the geographical isolation of Louisiade communities, high fuel costs and the low economic returns associated with the sale of shark fin (relative to sea cucumber). The influence of market access on shark fin production is also reflected in the modelled increase in shark fin production (119Ã‚Â kg per quarter on average) that occurred with the introduction of a transport boat in the region. Market access is likely to further improve, particularly if the sea cucumber fishery is reopened and/or shark fin prices increase. Therefore, low-cost, community-based management of shark resources based on the allocation of allowable shark catches to ward communities is recommended. Such an approach takes advantage of the communal characteristics of the local island communities as well as the fishery data collection and monitoring mechanisms that are already being used by the local government.

"The reimplementation of the Ra'ui: Coral reef management in Rarotonga, Cook Islands","This research focuses on coral reef health in the South Pacific region, an area of high global coral diversity. Coral reef health surrounding two study sites in Rarotonga. Cook Islands, has been assessed in areas that have not been previously surveyed. Each study site has distinct differences based upon marine management practices. Marine management practices are identified and described and some historical reasons as why they exist are discussed. Data are also presented on the ecological condition (coral coverage, number of coral species. clonal condition, disease, and presence and absence of bioindicators). This interdisciplinary research methodology includes both ecological and social data collection to further understand human-environment interactions.

Institutional and ecological interplay for successful self-governance of community-based fisheries,"The goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of the role of institutional arrangements and ecological factors that facilitate the emergence and sustainability of successful collective action in small-scale fishing social-ecological systems. Using a modified logistic growth function, we simulate how ecological factors (i.e. carrying capacity) affect small-scale fishing communities with varying degrees of institutional development (i.e. timeliness to adopt new institutions and the degree to which harvesting effort is reduced), in their ability to avoid overexploitation. Our results show that strong and timely institutions are necessary but not sufficient to maintain sustainable harvests over time. The sooner communities adopt institutions, and the stronger the institutions they adopt, the more likely they are to sustain the resource stock. Exactly how timely the institutions must be adopted, and by what amount harvesting effort must be diminished, depends on the ecological carrying capacity of the species at the particular location. Small differences in the carrying capacity between fishing sites, even under scenarios of similar institutional development, greatly affects the likelihood of effective collective action.

Socio-ecological vulnerability assessment in coastal communities in the BCLME region,"Climate change poses a key threat to marine ecosystems and fisheries resources as well as to communities that depend on these systems for food and livelihoods. This paper reports on a community-based rapid vulnerability assessment (RVA) methodology developed and applied in eight small-scale fishing communities in the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem region. This participatory methodology was designed to be applied in a workshop setting and draws on the observations, perceptions and local knowledge of fishers in order to better understand the extent to which their livelihoods are susceptible to various socio-ecological changes and their ability to respond to these changes. The paper highlights selected key findings and aims to demonstrate the type of information that can be elicited from an RVA. Although there were differences between the three countries involved in the study, findings suggest that key stressors are mainly associated with socio-economic and governance issues. Climate-related changes were seen to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Despite differences in spatial and temporal scales of data provided by scientists and fishers, changes in environmental conditions that could be attributed to climate change observed by fishers resonated with available science. Fishers identified a number of adaptation strategies that could address vulnerabilities and enhance resilience but require support from government and other stakeholders. Strengthening local organizations, rebuilding fisheries through local co-management plans, securing access rights, involving fishers in data collection and analysis, developing complementary livelihoods and addressing the broad socio-economic rights of communities were identified as necessary to address vulnerabilities. Participation in these community-level vulnerability assessments enhances understanding, builds capacity, generates knowledge for management, and allows communities to identify locally appropriate adaptation strategies.

"Octopuses in the south-west Pacific region: a review of fisheries, ecology, cultural importance and management","Octopuses present a difficult resource to manage because of their relatively short life spans, rapid growth rates, high natural mortality and seasonal fluctuations in abundance. With exploitation efforts increasing worldwide, particularly in the Pacific Island region, substantial knowledge gaps in their biology, exploitation and management remain. We conducted a literature review to summarise their species distribution, abundance, ecological attributes, utilization, importance and management within the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) of Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Tonga, Samoa and American Samoa. We found that 23 species of octopuses within 11 genera were recorded from these PICTs, belonging to the families Amphitretidae and Octopodidae. Overall, Tonga was the most speciose country with 11 occurrence records and Samoa recorded the least with just a single species. All other countries recorded between 2 and 8 taxa. The day octopus (Octopus cyanea) was recorded from all PICTsÃ‚Â except Samoa. There are no specific national regulations on octopus fisheries within the PICTs and management is largely dependent on overarching national fisheries legislation. However, community-based management efforts can be an effective platform in sustaining octopus stocks. Octopuses also play an important role in the folklore and customs of many Pacific Islanders, and we provide a summary of these for the specific PICTs assessed. This review highlights areas for further research and development for the Pacific Island region and the urgent need to address specific knowledge gaps on octopus taxonomy, stock assessment and fishery management.

Implementing strategies to overcome social-ecological traps: The role of community brokers and institutional bricolage in a locally managed marine area,"We examine collaborative arrangements for resource management between communities and external agencies, with a particular interest in how community-based interventions are integrated into local contexts. This timely inquiry comes in a period when participatory resource management approaches are increasingly being applied to overcome the perpetual cycles of poverty in which poor resource-dependent people find themselves, i.e., social-ecological traps. Much of the literature on social-ecological traps has focused on identifying conditions, factors, and responses that are important in, for example, alleviating systemic poverty or developing sustainable resource management systems. However, insufficient focus has been placed on understanding the practical processes by which strategies are implemented, and how these can reflexively affect the system itself. Drawing from a case study of a locally managed marine area in Indonesia, we examine the interactions between a nongovernment organization and a target community during the implementation of a fisheries management plan. Applying insights from rural development studies, we show how external interventions, designed to pull people out of social-ecological traps, are operationalized into forms that make them locally familiar and appropriate through actions of community brokers and processes of Ã¢â‚¬Å“institutional bricolage.Ã¢â‚¬Â We argue that as a consequence of implementing processes, such interventions should be expected to diverge from their initial science-based justification.

Fishing dynamics associated with periodically harvested marine closures,"Periodically-harvested fisheries closures are emerging as a socially acceptable and locally implementable way to balance concerns about conserving ecosystem function and sustaining livelihoods. Across the Indo-Pacific periodically-harvested closures are commonly employed, yet their contribution towards more sustainable fisheries remains largely untested in the social and ecological context of tropical small-scale fisheries. To address this, we use an interdisciplinary approach to examine harvesting dynamics that would affect sustainability, namely, fishing effort, yield, gear and method use, periodicity of harvesting, controls placed on harvesting and resource owners' decisions to open and close four fishing grounds in Solomon Islands. We compare these fishing patterns with those on surrounding, continuously open fishing grounds. Our study shows that total effort and total catch from periodically-harvested reef closures are low to moderate compared to reefs open to continuous fishing. When periodically-harvested closures were opened, effort in the closures was relatively intense, however, in most cases yield did not exceed annual benchmarks of sustainability described by previous studies. In some cases, harvesting during openings was restricted to a single taxon and single fishing gear and method, while in others there was unrestricted multi-species and multi-method harvesting. The duration and frequency of openings were highly variable, with open periods ranging from a single night to one month in duration, and occurring between one and 15 times per year. Fishing during openings was permitted for entire fishing communities in some cases, and only for specific rights-holding families in others. Decisions to open periodically-harvested closures tended to be based on immediate social or economic needs, and the openings provided a small boost to fish catch landed in communities. While periodically-harvested closures may alleviate fishing pressure in a small area of fishing grounds by reducing the opportunity to fish, openings of long duration or high frequency, combined with heavy or destructive exploitation, may lead to unsustainable harvesting within the area.

The Big Role of Coastal Communities and Small-Scale Fishers in Ocean Conservation,"Around the world, many coastal communities and small-scale fishers have proven effective as stewards of their local marine environments and resources. Given these considerable successes, this chapter assesses opportunities to increase the focus in ocean conservation practice and policy on initiatives at the local level of coastal communities and small-scale fishers. The chapter reviews the historical evolution of ocean conservation, with a focus on fundamental shifts to more holistic approaches of ecosystem-based and integrated management, and to a greater focus on participatory governance. These major shifts reinforce the role in ocean conservation of local-level coastal communities and small-scale fishers. Drawing on case studies of the Community Conservation Research Network, the rationale for a focus on local conservation is based on a trio of contributors: local knowledge, participation, and institutions. Four major conclusions are drawn with respect to national and international policy. First, achieving the full ocean conservation potential of coastal communities and small-scale fishers requires greater attention to and mainstreaming of this level of conservation. Second, governmental policy must better connect ocean conservation and coastal communities, so that decisions made by governments about ocean space and resources fully consider effects on communities. Third, the relevant scientific and management agencies must adapt institutionally to new realities, which can require restructuring programs and reassigning resources to better align with communities and ocean users. Fourth, opportunities for ""scaling-up"" from local initiatives to large-scale ocean management and ""scaling down"" in the reverse direction need to be better explored. Ã‚Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"Fishery management, human dimension","This article covers the realm of fishery management through the lens of human actions and decision making, and the regulations that have the potential to govern them. These social elements of fishery management are traditionally directed at facilitating alternative, less harmful scenarios than Ã¢â‚¬Å“open accessÃ¢â‚¬Â management in which no such regulations exist. Amidst the wide array of potential management activities used today, ranging from gear restriction to quotas, this article is primarily focused on unpacking the underlying themes that touch across all social dimensions of fishery management. One central element discussed in the article is the idea of cooperation, which extends to discussion on enforcement and surveillance, as well as stakeholder responses under various scenarios. Part of these themes includes some discussion on economics and rational decision making under management, as well as issues of fairness and participation in management planning.

Marine ecotourism for small pelagics as a source of alternative income generating activities to fisheries in a tropical community,"Widespread overharvest has led to marine ecosystem degradation and declining fishery catches in many tropical communities. To allow stocks to recover and provide increased flows of food and income, reductions in fishing effort are necessary. The development of Alternative Income Generating Activities can help to reduce the economic reliance of coastal communities on fishing, potentially reducing pressure on fish stocks. Here we assess the local conditions which have enabled the creation of Alternative Income Generating Activities to fishing based on marine ecotourism in Moalboal, Philippines. Importantly, while marine ecotourism typically centers around charismatic megafauna, a combination of nearshore fringing reefs, the establishment of nearshore marine protected areas and the occurrence of a consistently large herring aggregation provide a large tourism draw to this community. Using a combination of regional and local economic statistics and stakeholder surveys, we implement an economic valuation of Moalboal marine ecotourism for 2018 and compare this valuation to an independent estimate of the extractive value of the herring aggregation. The Moalboal case indicates that a combination of strong community engagement in the governance of the ecotourism resource, a network of locally managed marine protected areas and the retention and distribution of economic benefits within the local community have led to a significant marine ecotourism sector. We contextualize these conditions into a set of potential enabling conditions for marine ecotourism as an Alternative Income Generating Activity to fishing to contribute insights to diversifying livelihood opportunities beyond extractive fishing for coastal communities in the tropics.

Coral reef fisheries and the role of communities in their management,"Coral reefs are one of the world's most diverse and productive ecosystems, but are seriously under threat from the problems caused by overfishing. Recent population booms, combined with a low level of economic development make many tropical coastal communities highly dependent on natural resources, leading to extraction rates often significantly exceeding maximum sustainable yield. A lack of suitable alternatives, in terms of both livelihoods and food security, means the use of highly impacting gear types persists, a scenario characteristic of Malthusian overfishing. These economic and socio-biological concerns, typically associated with small-scale artisanal fisheries as seen around coral reefs, bring with them a unique set of problems for conservation managers to overcome. Traditionally in tropical communities, a strict approach of top-down management has been employed, focusing on command and control strategies, but these have tended to fail due, amongst other factors, to a lack of compliance from local stakeholders. Recently, however, there has been increased emphasis on adaptive community-based management, which acts both to empower local user groups, and to build upon the wealth of local ecological knowledge traditional fishing families possess. This chapter aims to introduce coral reef fisheries, describe the distinctive dynamics of coral reef artisanal fisheries, and explore the idea behind community management.

The spawning migrations of an exploited Albulid in the tropical Pacific: implications for conservation and community-based management,"Teleost fish that form predictable spawning aggregations and undertake reproductive migrations can be particularly vulnerable to overexploitation. To support community-based management of an artisanal fishery that targets bonefish (Albula glossodonta) spawning aggregations, we used a combination of acoustic telemetry, biological sampling, and remote imagery to reveal the spatiotemporal spawning migrations of bonefish on Anaa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia. The spawning migrations of bonefish tracked with acoustic telemetry were restricted to the northern section of the atoll, with 99.6% of all detections at offshore spawning habitats occurring on fixed acoustic receivers adjacent to the atollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artisanal fish trap complex. Male bonefish undertook spawning migrations more frequently than females and these spawning migrations were common during the Austral winter and fall. The movements of bonefish spawning aggregations coincided with the lunar cycle, as a network analysis revealed an increase in network size and the diversity of habitat use within our acoustic array throughout the duration of the waning moon. Our results highlighted the need for the management of the artisanal trap fishery to prevent the overharvest of bonefish during their peak spawning periods. In response to the spatiotemporal management recommendations derived from this research, the local government established an Educational Managed Marine Area that includes the atollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bonefish spawning migratory corridor adjacent to Tukuhora village and a Rahui (i.e., seasonal closure) to improve the sustainability of the fishery.

"Leadership, social capital and incentives promote successful fisheries","One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25% of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.

Sea cucumber management strategies: Challenges and opportunities in a developing country context,"Sea cucumbers play a critical role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. Sea cucumbers are also a key source of income for millions of small-scale fishers worldwide. The lucrative nature of this industry has led to severe reductions in sea cucumber populations in numerous regions globally. A large proportion of sea cucumber fisheries are located in developing countries, which present unique challenges to management, including addressing highly decentralized methods of extraction and processing, limited economic and technological resources for governance and, in many cases, a high dependency on sea cucumbers as a primary source of income for small-scale coastal fishers. In this review, we review the benefits and challenges of seven categories of sea cucumber management strategies used globally in developing countries, including gear restrictions, size and weight limits, effort and catch controls, temporal closures, area closures, value chain licensing and territorial use rights in fisheries. We conclude that sea cucumber management in developing countries could benefit from focusing regulatory solutions on narrowed parts of the value chain, coupling production-based management strategies with processing and export regulations and providing avenues for local fishers to inform policy at the local, regional and national levels.

A bright spot analysis of inland recreational fisheries in the face of climate change: learning about adaptation from small successes,"Inland recreational fisheries have social, economic, and ecological importance worldwide but these fisheries are increasingly challenged by the diverse effects of climate change. Coupled with other anthropogenic stressors, climate change has contributed to declines in freshwater biodiversity of greater severity than those observed across marine or terrestrial taxa. At a macro level, inland fisheries are experiencing declines. There are, however, a number of success stories, or Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbright spots,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ in inland recreational fisheries management, where innovative approaches are leading to increases in social and ecological well-being in the face of climate change. Cases such as these are important sources of inspiration and learning about adaptation to climate and environmental change. In this article, we analyze 11 examples of such Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbright spotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ drawn from multiple jurisdictions around the world from which we extracted lessons that might apply to fisheries management challenges beyond the region and context of each case. Collectively, these bright spots highlight adaptive initiatives that allow for recreational fisheries management to mitigate to stressors associated with current and future climate change. Examples identified include community-based restoration projects, collaborative and adaptive approaches to short-term fisheries closures, transdisciplinary large-scale conservation projects, and conservation-minded efforts by individuals and communities. By highlighting examples of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsmall winsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ within inland recreational fisheries management, this review contributes to the idea that a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpositive futureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for inland recreational fisheries in the face of climate change is possible and highlights potential strategies to adapt to current and future climate scenarios.

Tonga,"The Kingdom of Tonga is the only remaining constitutional monarchy in the South Pacific, with approximately 169 limestone and raised volcanic islands, scattered over an estimated ocean area of 700,000 km2. The marine habitats range from coastal mangrove stands and intertidal mud flats to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second deepest trench on the east, the Tongan Trench, and seamounts and hydrothermal vents scattered throughout the exclusive economic zones (EEZ). The population of Tonga heavily relies on its coastal and oceanic recourses for subsistence and commercial fishing, climate protection, and cultural and tourism activities. Until the mid-1990s, coastal areas and fisheries resources for Tongans were Ã¢â‚¬Å“open access,Ã¢â‚¬Â this drove marine resources exploitation to unsustainable levels and created a negative economic gain for local fishermen. In the early 2000s, the Fisheries legislation was amended to allow community-based nearshore management approaches. These coastal communities are working hard to restore marine resources and subsistence fishing, and over 30% of coastal communities are now engaged in the special management area programme. Despite low-resource management and enforcement of current legislation on marine resources, the Government of Tonga made a progressive stance toward ocean sustainability with the announcement of 30% marine protected areas within the EEZ at the United Nations Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our OceanÃ¢â‚¬Â Conference in June 2017.

Socioeconomics of individual transferable quotas and community-based fishery management,"In many fisheries around the world, the failures of centralized, top-down management have produced a shift toward co-management - collaboration and sharing of decision making between government and stakeholders. This trend has led to a major debate between two very different co-management approaches - community-based fishery management and market-based individual transferable quota management. This paper examines the debate over the relative merits of these models and undertakes a socioeconomic analysis of the two approaches. The paper includes (1) an analysis of differences in the structure, philosophical nature, and underlying value systems of each, including a discussion of their treatment of property rights; (2) a socioeconomic evaluation of the impacts of each system on boat owners, fishers, crew members, other fishery participants, and coastal communities, as well as the distribution of benefits and costs among fishery participants; and (3) examination of indirect economic effects that can occur through impacts on conservation and fishery sustainability. The latter relate to (a) the conservation ethic, (b) the flexibility of management, (c) the avoidance of waste, and (d) the efficiency of enforcement. The paper emphasizes the need for a broader approach to analyzing fishery management options, one that recognizes and properly assesses the diversity of choices, and that takes into account the interaction of the fishery with broader community and regional realities.

Angling management organizations: Integrating the recreational sector into fishery management,"This paper examines ways to reduce conflicts and improve the sustainability and value of marine recreational fisheries by fully integrating the recreational sector into the management of fisheries. One possibility involves a novel approach, here called angling management organizations (AMOs), which combines three of the more pervasive and promising trends in fishery management worldwide-management devolution, strengthened harvest rights, and co-management. AMOs are community-based organizations that are designed to conform to seven basic principles of integrated fishery management, which are described below. AMOs are loosely related to rights-based producer organizations in commercial fisheries, and are expected to strengthen resource stewardship, reduce enforcement and monitoring costs, alleviate management conflicts, and produce greater long-term net economic benefits in recreational fisheries. The other organizational structures considered here, including the management status quo, do not conform to all seven principles and are not expected to be as effective as AMOs.

Consideration of customary marine tenure system in the establishment of marine protected areas in the South Pacific,"The biodiversity of the South Pacific region is of global importance. Changes accompanying economic development have undermined the Pacific's traditional social systems, including their capacity for resource management, and the environment has suffered as a result. The South Pacific's social and land/marine tenure systems require local ownership involvements and management. Centralized administration and management systems which began in the colonial period had failed to promote marine resource management. Customary landowners need to be involved from the very beginning in decisions about the future of their resources. The need to establish marine protected areas (MPA) is urgent. Population growth, urbanization and rapid development are causing overharvesting of finite marine resources as well as pollution of the coastal zone. The success of MPA will depend on the customary right holders and their ability to satisfy both their subsistence needs and their aspiration for economic development. This paper proposes the establishment of MPAs in the South Pacific by using a strategy of community based management that has been established in the customary marine tenure system. The use of some traditional conservation method could also be effectively incorporated into MPA systems.",Maybe,"The paper is about the South Pacific region, which includes the countries listed in the SC, but it does not specify a particular country.","Maybe; The abstract mentions the South Pacific region, which includes the countries listed in the SC, but does not specify any particular country.

"Bottom-up community-based coral reef and fisheries restoration in Indonesia, Panama, and Palau","The Global Coral Reef Alliance (GCRA) works with community-based management efforts to restore severely damaged coral reefs and fisheries using its BiorockÃ‚Â® technology. In Bali, Indonesia, the village of Pemuteran used traditional village law to organize patrols to stop reef blast and cyanide fishing in their waters, establish marine protected areas for ecotourism and fish sanctuaries, and built more than 40 Biorock coral reef nurseries with a total length of over 500 meters. Their bottom-up efforts have won many national and international awards for community-based coastal zone management and underwater ecotourism. The visibly obvious buildup of fish populations has made fishing villages across Indonesia realize that they can grow corals and harvest fish and shellfish, farming reef ecosystems instead of hunting fish and destroying corals. Our workshops are training fishermen, dive shops, university students, and government fisheries agencies in the new methods of reef restoration. In Ukupseni, Panama, the Kuna Indian community has established solar powered Biorock coral nurseries, lobster habitats, and breakwaters to increase habitat for lobster (the economic basis of the region), and to protect their low lying islands from eroding. The Kunas are preparing their own coastal zone management plan to establish lobster hatcheries and create habitats to increase shelter and food for lobsters at all stages of their life cycle. In Palau, GCRA works with the Hatohobei State Government in the most isolated atolls. These islands suffered catastrophic mortality of corals and fish after record high temperatures in 1998 and are undergoing severe erosion. Projects are being planned to grow solar-powered Biorock breakwaters to save the islands and their culture, coral and fisheries habitat, and revive ancient techniques for fish habitat that have not been practiced for generations. The tools for large-scale community-based restoration of coastal marine habitats and fisheries now exist, but their implementation is being blocked by the lack of government policies backing community-based restoration and lack of funding for them from international agencies.

Participatory monitoring in community-based fisheries management through a gender lens,"In small-scale fisheries management, the significance of participation is widely recognised but we are still learning how this can be better operationalised to include different groups, such as women or Indigenous peoples. Participatory monitoring is one tool which has been used to increase participation in fisheries management. The aim of this review is to use critical interpretive synthesis to examine the literature on participatory monitoring within community-based fisheries management from a gender perspective. The synthesis identified and discussed several key areas: reasons presented in the literature for engaging with the themes of gender or participatory monitoring, gendered aspects of participatory monitoring, knowledge valuation and prioritisation in management, replicability and transparency of programme or research methods, and marginalisation narratives. Our findings show the complexities of conducting gender-aware participatory monitoring.

Predicted impact of the invasive lionfish Pterois volitans on the food web of a Caribbean coral reef,"The invasion of lionfish in the Caribbean is causing grave concern because of its deleterious impacts on coral reef food-webs. We have used an Ecopath-with-Ecosim model to predict the impacts of lionfish invasion on a coral reef community based on pre-invasion fish community data. Forty-six groups were defined, and an initial Ecopath model was balanced with a near-zero biomass of lionfish. In Ecosim, the near-zero biomass was eradicated by applying a very high fishing pressure in the first year of simulation. We subsequently (re-)introduced lionfish with a very low biomass, and allowed them to increase to very high abundance. With a near-zero lionfish biomass, the great majority of mesocarnivorous/omnivorous coral reef fish were predicted to be dominant while sharks were predicted to be the apex predators. Different management scenarios were established in the ecosystem to explore the eradication and resilience of lionfish. The management scenarios showed that if all adult lionfish were exploitable it will in theory be possible to fish the lionfish to a very low level, but the fishing pressure will have to be maintained, or the lionfish will recover. If the largest individuals are unexploitable it will be much more difficult to control the lionfish population.

Indicators of herbivorous fish biomass in community-based marine management areas in Fiji,"There has been a resurgence in community-based management of coral reef resources in the developing world over the last two decades. However, many of the threats to reef ecosystems are increasing at a rate beyond local knowledge acquisition. Consequently, there is a continuing need for management tools and monitoring to support community-based approaches. Using algal, fish and reef indicators we provide a rapid assessment method of herbivorous fishes in Locally Managed Marine Areas in Fiji. The algal indicator technique provided a time-integrated assessment of the process of herbivory within Locally Managed Marine Areas and could be used by untrained community members to quantify management responses. Generally, reefs with higher herbivore biomass had a diverse low biomass of algae typical of healthy reefs. Reefs with fewer herbivores had a higher biomass of turf or leathery algae typical of degraded reefs. These results show that simple ecological indicators can be a useful addition to the existing local knowledge that underpins community-based management.

Community-based citizen science projects can support the distributional monitoring of fishes,"Effective conservation and fisheries management requires data to capture demographic processes and range limits for each species to maximize population health and productivity. This need is constrained by limited funding and resources, particularly for countries with large land areas and coastlines as well as expansive exclusive economic zones. This imbalance means that monitoring efforts are often focused on targets of commercial and recreational fishing, which results in incomplete distributional records for non-target, small-bodied, and/or cryptic species. Community-based citizen science projects offer one potential alternative for scientists and fisheries managers needing this type of information but lacking sufficient resources to gather it. This study investigated whether data sourced from an online citizen science project (iNaturalist: Australasian Fishes) can assist in the distributional monitoring of a subset of fish species. Given the regional focus of this citizen science project, distributional data in the form of occurrence records for abundant, protected, and threatened fish species as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Australia and New Zealand were explored. Data for important commercial and recreational fishery targets in New South Wales were also explored, as a case study of a large jurisdiction with extensive monitoring requirements. The occurrence records for some of these categories of fishes were well represented in the quality-filtered citizen science data set, particularly endemic fishes whose threat status had not yet been assessed and species not currently under any form of management. Despite gaps in coverage between major urban centres, citizen science data for the best represented endemic fishes were qualitatively comparable to the available geographic distributions for these species. We suggest that quality-filtered citizen science data can in fact be used to improve taxonomic representation and the geographic breadth of species monitoring with increased participation.

FISHERIES LIVELIHOODS,"Fisheries provide livelihoods for millions of people in the Global South, from activities including fish portering, trading and shipping, repairing gears and boats, as well catching and processing fish. The majority of people derive their livelihood from small-scale fisheries, managed through state, community-based or collaborative regimes, though to a large extent most fisheries are open access in practice. This chapter introduces characteristics associated with small-scale fisheries and critiques of those, takes a value chain and gendered lens to identify actors involved in fisheries, examines what poverty means within fisheries and identifies sources of vulnerability associated with fisheries livelihoods, and how fisherfolk respond to those. The chapter concludes by observing how such vulnerabilities will be exacerbated by climate change, requiring more effective management and governance to secure livelihoods, food and nutrition, and ecosystem sustainability.

"Dominant discourses, among fishers and middlemen, of the factors affecting coral reef fish distributions in Solomon Islands","Understanding resource stakeholders' perceptions of resource condition and management is vital to the formulation of efficacious management policy to sustain natural systems because agreement among stakeholders is likely to result in more effective outcomes. Understanding perceptions is particularly important in the context of coral reefs because threats are often diverse and management options are numerous, and therefore perceptions are likely to be diverse. This study identified the dominant discourses of reef fish decline, and increase, among 119 fishers and fish traders (herein middlemen) in Solomon Islands, and compared these discourses to current scientific knowledge. Discourses were then explored for dominant themes that might improve understanding of resource user perceptions. The findings suggest that certain fisher and middlemen discourses align with scientific understanding of the causal links between human activity and fish stock declines, and that many of the elicited management strategies are aligned with current scientific recommendations. A theme that emerged across the fisher and middlemen discourses of fish decline was a dichotomy in perception between fishing for economic affluence and fishing for subsistence and economic survival. A theme that emerged across discourses of fish increase was a dichotomy between support for command-and-control approaches and support for community-based approaches to management. Differences between some fisher and middlemen discourses were explained by the location in which interviews were conducted suggesting consensual perceptions achieved through local knowledge networks. Similarity between scientific understanding and local perceptions suggests that local resource users are aware of, and might support, fishery management strategies based on scientific evidence. Such strategies must consider factors such as location because resource user perceptions differ between locations and because many threats to the fishery and preferred management strategies are likely to be context specific.

The aim is to preserve both the marine ecosystem and promote the socio-economic development of traditional CofradÃƒÂ­as (local fisher communities). A qualitative methodological framework, based on participatory problem-solution trees and focus groups, was implemented to identify the main obstacles impeding the sustainable development of the artisanal fishing sector on the island. Collective proposals with policy implications are also discussed. The community involved identified four main issues that are causing an unsustainable island fishery: 1) Overexploitation; 2) Poor self-management of CofradÃƒÂ­as and commercialisation problems; 3) Fisher individualism and low co-management strategies, and 4) Illegal fishing increase vs. artisanal fishing decline. Results show the required policy enhancements to tackle those issues with, for instance, the creation of marine protected areas, the promotion of a common islander vision, and an increase in participatory research projects between scientists and fishers. Participants also revealed the necessity to adapt existing regulations to local specificity to reduce the gap between policy makers and local community.

Population dynamics of roundjaw bonefish Albula glossodonta at a remote coralline Atoll inform community-based management in an artisanal fishery,"Fisheries management requires knowledge on the population dynamics of exploited stocks. To that end, the present study used a markÃ¢â‚¬â€œrecapture approach to characterise the population demographics of roundjaw bonefish Albula glossodonta (ForsskÃƒÂ¥l) and their interaction with a data-limited fishery on Anaa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. Over the course of the study, 2,509 bonefish were tagged and 12.3% were recaptured. The LÃ¢Ë†Å¾ of bonefish was estimated at 71Ã‚Â cm fork length (FL) with a K of 0.17, based on changes in FL between capture events. Artisanal fish traps located in the migratory corridors of the atoll accounted for 94% of recaptures and these movements occurred during the waning moon. Fishing mortality increased as bonefish reach sexual maturity, recruiting to the trap fishery at age 4 with the onset of spawning behaviour. Bonefish abundance between ages 3 and 5 was estimated to be 29,079 individuals. This case study demonstrated the utility of markÃ¢â‚¬â€œrecapture in filling knowledge gaps that impede the management of data-limited fisheries. Ultimately, these results supported the creation of an Educational Managed Marine Area and the resurgence of rahui (seasonal closure) to manage this fishery.

Maritime claims and management rights of indigenous peoples: Rising tides in the Pacific and Northern Waters,"This paper surveys the rising tide of indigenous peoples' claims to marine resources throughout the Pacific and Northern Waters. Described are claims and gains by Maoris in New Zealand, Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, Hawaiians and northwest US Native Americans in the United States, Haida, Alaska Inuit, Canadian Inuit, and Greenlanders. Almost all these groups have (re)gained rights to traditional uses of marine resources and some have achieved the right to be consulted regarding marine resource management decisions. More needs to be, and will be accomplished. The extension of coastal state resiurce jurisdiction into the marine sphere and the attendant management responsibilities provide a creative context for forging new accommodations between national governments and coastal indigenous groups. Concepts that indigenous groups could use to bolster arguments and strategies to achieve further gains include international human rights principles, internal application of law of the sea principles, the conservation benefits of community-based marine resource management, and demilitarization-denuclearization.

"Applying a ridge-to-reef framework to support watershed, water quality, and community-based fisheries management in American Samoa","Water quality and fisheries exploitation are localized, chronic stressors that impact coral reef condition and resilience. Yet, quantifying the relative contribution of individual stressors and evaluating the degree of human impact to any particular reef are difficult due to the inherent variation in biological assemblages that exists across and within island scales. We developed a framework to first account for island-scale variation in biological assemblages, and then evaluate the condition of 26 reefs adjacent to watersheds in Tutuila, American Samoa. Water quality data collected over 1Ã‚Â year were first linked with watershed characteristics such as land use and human population. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations were best predicted by total human population and disturbed land for watersheds with over 200 humans kmÃ¢Ë†â€™2, providing a predictive threshold for DIN enrichment attributed to human populations. Coral reef assemblages were next partitioned into three distinct reeftypes to account for inherent variation in biological assemblages and isolate upon local stressors. Regression models suggested that watershed characteristics linked with DIN and fishing access best predicted ecological condition scores, but their influences differed. Relationships were weakest between coral assemblages and watershed-based proxies of DIN, and strongest between fish assemblages and distances to boat harbors and wave energy (i.e., accessibility). While we did not explicitly address the potential recursivity between fish and coral assemblages, there was a weak overall correlation between these ecological condition scores. Instead, the more complex, recursive nature between reef fish and habitats was discussed with respect to bottom-up and top-down processes, and several ongoing studies that can better help address this topic into the future were identified. The framework used here showed the spatial variation of stressor influence, and the specific assemblage attributes influenced by natural and anthropogenic drivers which aims to guide a local ridge-to-reef management strategy.

Fishery co-management: A practical handbook,"During the last decade, there has been a shift in the governance and management of fisheries to a broader approach that recognizes the participation of fishers, local stewardship, and shared decision-making. Through this process, fishers are empowered to become active members of the management team, balancing rights and responsibilities, and working in partnership with government. This approach is called co-management. This handbook describes the process of community-based co-management from its beginning, through implementation, to turnover to the community. It provides ideas, methods, techniques, activities, checklists, examples, questions and indicators for the planning and implementing of a process of community-based co-management. It focuses on small-scale fisheries (freshwater, floodplain, estuarine, or marine) in developing countries, but is also relevant to small-scale fisheries in developed countries and to the management of other coastal resources (such as coral reefs, mangroves, sea grass, and wetlands). This handbook will be of significant interest to resource managers, practitioners, academics and students of small-scale fisheries. Ã‚Â© International Development Research Centre 2006.

Community science: A typology and its implications for governance of social-ecological systems,"There is an increasing recognition globally of the role to be played by community science Ã¢â‚¬â€œscientific research and monitoring driven and controlled by local communities, and characterized by place-based knowledge, social learning, collective action and empowerment. In particular, community science can support social-ecological system transformation, and help in achieving better Ã¢â‚¬ËœfitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ between ecological systems and governance, at local and higher levels of decision making. This paper draws on three examples of communities as central actors in the process of knowledge co-production to present a typology of community science, and to deduce a set of key principles/conditions for success. The typology involves three social learning models in which the community acquires scientific knowledge by (1) engaging with external bodies, (2) drawing on internal volunteer scientific expertise, and/or (3) hiring (or contracting) in-house professional scientific expertise. All of these models share the key characteristic that the local community decides with whom they wish to engage, and in each case, social learning is fundamental. Some conditions that facilitate community science include: community-driven and community-control; flexibility across leadership models; connection to place and collective values; empowerment, agency and collective action; credible trust; local knowledge; and links to governance. Community science is not a panacea for effecting change at the local level, and there is need for critical assessment of how it can help to fill governance gaps. Nevertheless, a considerable body of experience globally illustrates how local communities are drawing effectively on community science for better conservation and livelihood outcomes, in a manner compatible with broader trends toward ecosystem-based management and local stewardship.

Conflict and collective action in Tonle Sap fisheries: adapting governance to support community livelihoods,"This paper presents the results of action research conducted from 2009 to 2015 on the dynamics of resource conflict concerning fisheries and livelihoods in the Tonle Sap Lake, as well as the institutional context and strategies for institutional adaptation to address such conflicts equitably. Over the past 15 years, Cambodia has made significant advances in building the policy framework, regulations and institutions to support community-based fisheries management and increase the sector's contribution to the rural economy. However, fundamental challenges of increased resource conflict and loss of livelihoods by the most vulnerable remain. Key sources of conflict include destructive and illegal fishing practices, clearing of flooded forests, competing uses of land and water, and overlapping resource claims. Addressing these challenges requires collective action by all key actors: local fishers, the private sector, civil society, development partners, and government from the local to the national level. We identify and elaborate upon four governance priorities: (1) clarify roles and responsibilities in fisheries management; (2) link civil society and government efforts in law enforcement; (3) strengthen partnerships for livelihoods development; and (4) integrate fisheries management into decentralised development planning.

Indicators of coral reef ecosystem recovery following reduction in logging and implementation of community-based management schemes in the Solomon Islands,"The livelihood of many coastal communities in the Pacific Islands is directly dependent on the health of adjacent coral reefs. Reduction in water quality and over-harvesting of herbivorous fish are known to drive reef ecosystems towards a more degraded state. Community-based resource management practices have the potential to improve damaged reefs but quantitative data on their effectiveness remains largely unreported. This study investigated how land use changes and implementation of marine management influenced water quality, herbivorous fish biomass and reef condition of Marovo Lagoon in the Solomon Islands. Four study sites were located along a gradient of water quality, with two of the sites located inside marine protected areas (MPAs) designated in 2006. The results suggest that water quality in coastal areas adjacent to catchments modified by logging was negatively impacted. However, following natural revegetation of bare soil in the catchment between 2000 and 2010, water quality improved at all sites. The biomass of herbivorous fish was significantly greater in the MPAs compared to other sites and, importantly, we detected an increase in herbivore biomass between 2005 and 2008. Inshore reefs adjacent to logging operations had significantly lower coral cover and higher macroalgal cover than those offshore. Between 2005 and 2008 all sites showed an increase in crustose coralline algae cover and a decrease in turf algae colonising rocks, with the changes indicative of improving reef health. Collectively, these results indicate that reduction in logging and implementation of community-based management can have a positive influence on reefs in Marovo Lagoon.",Yes,"The study is based in the Solomon Islands, which is one of the countries of interest according to the SC.","Yes; The paper is a case study from the Solomon Islands, which is one of the countries listed in the SC.

Vanuatu,"This chapter reviews and assesses the condition of the marine environment in Vanuatu mainly from unpublished sources. It is in generally very good condition. However, severe damage from cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks have caused considerable damage to reefs in recent years, and reefs near major population centres show signs of degradation. Some reefs are threatened by increased siltation from logging in catchment areas, nutrient enrichment from sewage pollution and from over-exploitation of reef fish. Sewage disposal, domestic and solid wastes are serious environmental concerns in urban areas and, as a result, water quality is generally poor. There are generally no refuse dumps in many rural areas, and beaches, streams and lagoons are heavily littered. Industrial marine pollutant loadings appear to be increasing. Trochus, green snails and land crabs (Birgus latro) have declined because of high rates of exploitation and the giant clam, Tridacna gigas, has been driven into extinction through excessive harvesting in Vanuatu. Turtles and dugongs are endangered and are sensitive to over-hunting. The huge leatherback turtle which also occurs here is threatened with extinction because of egg collection. Seabirds have also been significantly depleted through egg collection at rookeries and through disturbance of nesting sites through clearing. There is limited management of the marine environment in Vanuatu and very little environmental awareness, technical or financial resources for this. Recent marine awareness-raising through workshops, drama, radio broadcasts has been successful in establishing community-based marine sanctuaries for replenishing overfished trochus and giant clams. Some village-based fishing restrictions on fishing methods, fishing ground closures and size restrictions have been initiated and implemented. But there is generally a lack of finances and technical expertise to support monitoring programmes or to implement and enforce legislation and policies pertaining to the marine environment. Vanuatu has declared a moderate number of marine protected areas (MPA) but the involvement of customary fishing right owners is integral to the success of MPAs in Vanuatu.

Community-based coral reef conservation in the Bay Islands of Honduras,"The evolution of a community-based marine conservation effort in the Bay Islands serves as a valuable example to all islands that face similarly conflicting economic and environmental pressures. Like many small developing tropical islands, the main island of Roatan is undergoing rapid development to accommodate a surge in nature tourism. As the traditional fish and shrimping industries have dwindled, the island's economic base has become increasingly dependent on the growth of reef-based tourism.

Detecting fisheries trends in a co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga,"Community based and co-management approaches are increasingly used strategies for marine conservation and sustainable management in the tropical Pacific. However, our understanding of the effectiveness of co-management on marine resources and socio economic conditions is relatively limited, often due to insufficient resources to support monitoring based on ecological condition or catch landings data. Monitoring programmes based on the perceptions of resource users are often presented as a cost effective alternative to understanding the status and changes in resource and socio economic conditions. Ecological, catch landings and perception-based data, and their collection methods, have different benefits and limitations for community-based programmes. Here we present a study of the first community-based, co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga Ã¢Ë†â€™ the small island of Ã¢â‚¬ËœO'ua. We examine both perception-based data from interviews and catch landings data to describe fishing activities, catches and changes in resource status and socio economic conditions since the inception of co-management. Landings data were collected by the community over a five year period; perceptions of change and management performance were collected through structured interviews with fishers based on the same time period. The majority of fishing within the Ã¢â‚¬ËœO'ua co-managed area was by men, using hand spears in fibreglass vesselsÃ¢â‚¬â€°<5Ã‚Â m in length powered by an outboard engine. We found that catch per unit effort was high (especially the estimates generated from perception data) compared to other parts of the Pacific. Since the inception of co-management fishers reported improved socio economic conditions, a greater sense of stewardship over resources, active involvement in management and the effective exclusion of Ã¢â‚¬ËœoutsideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fishers. We compared catch and catch-per-unit-effort estimates generated from landings and perception data. While fishers perceived that catches had improved since the inception of co-management, landings data suggested that catches were either stable or declining. These differences are important as they would suggest very different management responses. We discuss the trade-offs between the catch landings and perception data in terms of accuracy, precision, participation and cost for the purpose of guiding adjustments to co-management.

"First trial of wild juvenile collection of tropical sea cucumbers from settling larvae, using coconut fibre from waste husks in Solomon Islands: A new conservation tool","Wild juvenile collection (WJC) from settling larvae has been reported for two temperate holothurians (Apostichopus japonicus and Apostichopus californicus), mainly for the objective of restocking, but its applicability to tropical holothurians is unknown. This study, for the first time, tested the applicability of WJC for tropical sea cucumbers. First, hatchery-produced larvae of peanutfish (Stichopus horrens) before settlement were introduced in a tank in which bundles of coconut fibre, rolled mesh bags, and oyster shells were suspended to identify the most suitable settlement material. The results showed that the coconut fibre and mesh bags collected more settling larvae than the oyster shells. Second, 25 collectors were installed for 3Ã‚Â months in the field in Nggela, Solomon Islands. The newly designed simple collector comprised between two and four net bags filled with coconut fibre, which were tied to a rope vertically moored between a concrete block anchor and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle floats. A total of 14 juvenile holothurians were collected, including StichopusÃ‚Â cf.Ã‚Â horrens, stonefish (Actinopyga lecanora), kingfish (Synapta maculata), and five unidentified species. It is characteristic of tropical WJC that diverse species can be collected simultaneously (including rare, non-culturable species), which is advantageous over hatchery production for restocking purposes. The total yield corresponded to approximately 1% of the total abundance of the ambient holothurian community, demonstrating potential for restocking, considering the ease of the extension and repetition of the trials. Collection in the inner bay areas was successful, whereas rough weather physically damaged the collectors in areas open to the ocean. These results show that WJC is a viable option for tropical holothurians. Thus, the use of the low-cost, simple collectors using coconut fibre could be a new conservation measure for endangered holothurian resources, and are manageable by local communities.

"The Coral, Solomon and Bismarck Seas Region","The Coral, Solomon, and Bismarck Seas lie in the western equatorial Pacific, bounded by Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG and the Solomon Islands are the coastal countries discussed. North-south migration of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone brings about alternating Trade Wind and monsoon conditions. The South Equatorial Current (SEC) drives the major ocean circulation. The region's major land mass is mainland Papua New Guinea (PNG). All remaining land is grouped into archipelagos. Major coastal ecosystems are coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, soft estuary and lagoon bottoms, inland saltwater lagoons, and freshwater coastal wetlands. The biodiversity of these coastal ecosystems i of global significance in extent and diversity and, overall, their condition is generally good. Little of the baseline knowledge needed to monitor trends and to assess environmental change is available, and the level of research and survey is very low. Through the open seas of the region are characterised by low primary production, it is likely that upwelling and turbulent mixing around reefs and islands results in localised areas of high primary productivity. The region's large pelagic tuna resource is being exploited by both PNG and the Solomon Islands. Both receive support in this from the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA). The majority of the population of the countries of the region (about 1.4 million) lives along the 22,400 km coastline. Port Moresby is the largest urban population (250,000). Urban centres are characterised by inadequate provision for treatment and disposal of human and industrial wastes, localised overfishing, coastline disturbances arising from land sediment discharge, and from poorly designed and positioned engineering structures, and chronic low-level pollution. Outside urban areas the level of material development is very low and most people live a mixed subsistence and artisanal lifestyle. While traditional agriculture is the main source of food and livelihood there is a high degree of dependence upon coastal fisheries for both subsistence and income. Few coastal villagers are solely farmer or fisher. Local fisheries are diverse and, apart from the wide range of finfish and invertebrates taken for food, there is an export trade in sea cucumbers (to produce beche-de-mer), molluscs (for mother-of-pearl), and a few high-value food species. Not only are these stocks inherently difficult to manage but coastal fisheries management capacity in the countries of the region is very low. Over-exploitation is common. Recently, a trade in live reef food fish for export has emerged. Characterised by a quick depletion of stocks, and the use of toxic substances for stunning fish, it is considered to be a significant threat to the sustainability of coastal marine resources and to coral reef ecosystems. Land-slips and their sediment plumes in nearby coastal waters are a natural feature of the dynamic landscape. Where land is disturbed by logging and agriculture, additional sediment stress on aquatic ecosystems is superimposed on this natural background stress. Poor logging practices are effecting major changes in the nature of the land and the ecosystems from which freshwater enters the sea. Sediment loads are increased, stressing coral reefs and seagrass beds. This is accompanied by increases in the amount of freshwater runoff, adding further stress. Domestic sewage is the most important source of point-source pollution, not only in urban areas but sometimes in rural lagoons. The low level of industrial development has precluded widespread industrial pollution but localised pollution from mines, breweries, food and agricultural processing plants, and probably other industries has occurred. There is no systematic water quality, biological, or public health monitoring of coastal waters. Though both countries in the region have a legislative and administrative base for environmental and resource management, effective implementation is compromised by a lack of political will and weak-and declining-capacity in the management agencies. Increased attention is being paid to the promotion and support of community-based approaches that incorporate elements of traditional land and sea tenure systems and management practices.",Yes,"The paper includes case studies from Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea, which are among the countries listed in the SC.","Yes; The abstract mentions Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea, which are part of the countries listed in the SC.

Ecosystem services approach for community-based ecotourism: towards an equitable and sustainable blue economy,"This paper examines the role of community-based ecotourism within the developing market dynamics of the blue economy. The blue economy has become synonymous with generating wealth from ocean-related activities while protecting and supporting marine ecosystems. For remote coastal communities and Small Island Developing States, local economic development is a challenging balance between protecting marine biodiversity and maintaining sustainable and direct access to ecosystem services. In this paper, we present results of a study in the coastal region of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia in the Coral Triangle. The paper illustrates that community-based ecotourism supports sustainable use of marine resources and offers an entry point for low-resource coastal communities to take part in the blue economy. Complementary livelihood pathways that enhance primary income and support ecosystem services play a key role. Study findings show that three key areas where multilateral support is most needed for communities with ecotourism aspirations are: waste management, hospitality skills, and market access. From these findings, we present a model for community-based ecotourism in the blue economy. The model demonstrates important interactions between community, the local economy, and coastal ecosystems, and the important role community-based ecotourism plays in creating effective mechanisms for preserving natural and cultural heritage.

Exploring gender inclusion in small-scale fisheries management and development in Melanesia,"Fisheries, like other sectors, is not immune to gender inequality, and women tend to experience the brunt of inequality as undervalued and underrepresented actors in fisheries management and development. A comprehensive understanding of the gender approaches in use, including potential barriers to their implementation, is needed to promote gender equitable outcomes in the small-scale fisheries (SSF) sector. We conducted interviews with fisheries managers and practitioners working in Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu between 2018 and 2019. We found gender inclusive approaches were broadly applied in three ways: (a) through community-based projects and programs (e.g., inclusive participation techniques); (b) national level research and policy; and (c) internal organizational operations (e.g. gender-sensitive recruitment policies). Although fisheries organizations approached gender inclusion in diverse ways, when critically evaluated according to gender best practice we found 76.2% of approaches were designed to Ã¢â‚¬ËœreachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ women, and very few Ã¢â‚¬ËœbenefitedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœempoweredÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, or Ã¢â‚¬ËœtransformedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ women's lives. Ã¢â‚¬ËœGenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was conflated to Ã¢â‚¬ËœwomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ indicating a poor understanding of what gender inclusion means in practice. We found gender inclusive approaches were limited by the knowledge and capacities of fisheries managers and practitioners, and inhibitive institutional cultures. We argue that SSF organizations need to build explicit institutional gender commitment, strategies and systematic efforts to implement gender approaches with effective accountability mechanisms in place. While the fisheries sector is in its infancy, the plethora and diversity of development organizations in the Pacific provides a unique opportunity to build strategic partnerships to improve gender inclusion in practice in SSF management and development. Such a step can assist the transition from gender inclusive approaches being Ã¢â‚¬ËœnewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to the Ã¢â‚¬ËœnormÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ whilst setting a benchmark for what is acceptable practice.
