0,A comparison of frameworks and objectives for implementation of marine protected areas in Northern Europe and in Southeast Asia,"A proliferation of marine protected areas around the world, including Europe and Southeast Asia, is evidence of a growing global concern for the marine environment and its living resources. While marine protected areas in Europe on a wider scale have generally been considered a tool for either nature conservation or a technical measure in management of fisheries, overall management objectives of marine protected areas in Southeast Asian countries have varied more significantly between countries and sites due to differences in societal needs and opportunities, spatial scales, environmental conditions and varying threats. These differences have resulted in different approaches to marine protected area development and management. Management of the Northern European marine environment and its living resources is highly sectoral and largely determined by central directives and policies stemming from the European Union, such as the Habitats Directive and the Common Fisheries Policy. This paper however, will touch upon an ongoing evolution within the European Union from a strictly sectoral approach to marine protected areas and marine management, towards a more integrated, ecosystem approach to management of fisheries and the marine environment. In Southeast Asia, marine protected area development is usually determined by individual governments, municipalities and coastal communities, based upon specific needs and settings. Examples of such marine protected areas in Vietnam and the Philippines will be described, including their underlying institutional frameworks and objectives such as tourism, management of artisanal fisheries, etc. Examples of differences and similarities between Northern European and Southeast Asian marine protected areas will be presented and areas in which regions might learn from one another identified. For instance, where Southeast Asian protected areas have addressed the inevitable interdependency between healthy ecosystems and sustainable coastal fisheries for decades, marine protected areas in Northern Europe usually address either large scale management of stocks of individual fish species or nature conservation. Tourism has long been an overarching driving force in marine protected area implementation in SE Asia, while in Northern Europe especially this has only had little influence on overall objectives pertaining to the marine environment.

1,"Antenatal care in rural Bangladesh: Current state of costs, content and recommendations for effective service delivery","Background: Measurement of antenatal care (ANC) service coverage is often limited to the number of contacts or type of providers, reflecting a gap in the assessment of quality as well as cost estimations and health impact. The study aims to determine service subcomponents and provider and patient costs of ANC services and compares them between community (i.e. satellite clinics) and facility care (i.e. primary and secondary health centers) settings in rural Bangladesh. Methods: Service contents and cost data were collected by one researcher and four interviewers in various community and facility health care settings in Gaibandha district between September and December 2016. We conducted structured interviews with organization managers, observational studies of ANC service provision (n = 70) for service contents and provider costs (service and drug costs) and exit interviews with pregnant women (n = 70) for patient costs (direct and indirect costs) in health clinics at community and facility levels. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine any different patient characteristics between community and facility settings. ANC service contents were assessed by 63 subitems categorized into 11 groups and compared within and across community and facility settings. Provider and patient costs were collected in Bangladesh taka and analyzed as 2016 US Dollars (0.013 exchange rate). Results: We found generally similar provider and patient characteristics between the community and facility settings except in clients' gestational age. High compliance (> 50%) of service subcomponents were observed in blood pressure monitoring, weight measurement, iron and folate supplementation given, and tetanus vaccine, while lower compliance of service subcomponents (< 50%) were observed in some physical examinations such as edema and ultrasonogram and routine tests such as blood test and urine test. Average unit costs of ANC service provision were about double at the facility level ($2.75) compared with community-based care ($1.62). ANC patient costs at facilities ($2.66) were about three times higher than in the community ($0.78). Conclusion: The study reveals a delay in pregnant women's initial ANC care seeking, gaps in compliance of ANC subcomponents and difference of provider and patient costs between facility and community settings.

2,When a Shark Is More Than a Shark: A Sociopolitical Problem-Solving Approach to Fisher-Shark Interactions,"Fisheries are often conceptualized through a biophysical lens resulting in management approaches that fail to account for stakeholder conflicts and sociopolitical inequities. Using a fisher engagement approach, this case study examines the sociopolitical dimensions of fisher-shark interactions in pursuit of more complete problem definitions and effective solutions. Through interviews with HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi small boat fishers and observations of a community-based shark-tagging project, we examined fisher perspective, socioeconomic landscapes, stakeholder relationships, and power dynamics. We interpreted these data using an adapted framework that mobilizes concepts from conflict theory and problem definition. We discovered that economic cost, sharks as fishing competitors, and factors of fishers' on-the-water decisions define the fisher-shark interaction problem at the dispute level. Deeper conflicts include fishers' poor perceptions of management legitimacy, degraded relationships with researchers and managers, threatened fisher identities, and poor enforcement capacity. Together, dispute and deeper conflicts limit the effectiveness of singular approaches (e.g., regulation) to mitigate fisher-shark interactions and necessitate multi-pronged solutions with substance-, process-, and relationships-based components. This case study documented one such multi-pronged strategy employing fisher-researcher knowledge exchange, collaborative research, and means of more transparent communication. This strategy has the potential to affect both dispute- and deeper-level outcomes by advancing collective understanding of sharks and shark-handling tools, fisher behavior, and reducing shark mortality. Thus, a sociopolitical approach to problem-solving may yield greater collective benefits to fisheries stakeholders and sharks, with broader implications for the systemic management of complex human and biophysical ecosystem components.

3,Prospects of community-based co-management of Philippine abalone fishery,"The Philippine abalone fisheries has been in a continuous decline in the last two decades. From an all-time high of 633 mt in 2004, exports declined to 218 mt in 2008. Reasons cited for the decline are the harvesting of abalone juveniles and broodstock, indiscriminate and destructive methods of harvesting, occurrence of disasters due to anthropogenic and natural causes, and the absence of a management plan for abalone. This paper explores the prospect of community-based co-management (CBCM) approach in addressing the decreasing production of abalone from the wild. The challenges faced by women and men abalone fishers-absence of organized abalone fishers, weak implementation of fishery laws and lack of policy for abalone management, general lack of knowledge on the biology of abalone, and the much needed co-management arrangement with various stakeholders, provide a very fertile ground for community organizing. Community organizing as an over-all strategy in the implementation of the four interrelated components of CBCM provide some prospects for better management of abalone fisheries. The four components of CBCM are: resource management that aims to protect, conserve, regulate and improve the management of abalone fishery resources; community and economic development and livelihood which hopes to widen the socio-economic opportunities to improve people's well-being; capacity building that aims to increase people's knowledge on the biology of abalone and their awareness on the need for its judicious management; and, institutional support, networking and advocacy that hopes to enable the various stakeholders-fishers, LGUs, academe, research institutions to work together and share in the benefits of management. The sharing of responsibilities and authority based on each partner's resources and capacities may be a contentious issue but CBCM has to deal with it. While CBCM is not a one-size-fits-all strategy to address the complex issues of fisheries management, the challenges present in the different study areas call for a CBCM approach that is adaptive and context-specific. The collective learning process innate in CBCM shall provide the best alternatives that will ensure that abalone fisheries will be sustained.

4,"Not satisfactory, but still acceptable: Exploring socioeconomic incentives of individual quota systems in Japanese Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries from the management leadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perspective","The individual quota (IQ) system is a rights-based management system that has been implemented in many countries, despite its lack of quota transferability. The purpose of this study was to explore the incentives behind the introduction of a non-transferable IQ system from the management leadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perspective through comparative case study of three Japanese Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) fisheries with different community units. In 2019Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2020, process tracing was conducted through semi-structured interviews with fisheries management staff, prefectural governments, and fishing cooperative associations who play an important role in introducing the IQ system in each community. In each case, in order to set allocations and to manage catch quotas, local fishers could participate in the council or by attending meetings. With a high priority for complying with the defined PBF catch quotas, the IQ system was finally introduced, either as a standalone system or combined with other management methods. While the non-transferable IQ systems in the case studies were not necessarily selected as satisfactory, but still considered acceptable, our data suggests that socioeconomic incentives, including revenue improvement and ensuring equity, were important. These incentives were not triggered by the system per se, but were due to a well-functioning co-management system. Recently, there has been a shift from voluntary IQ systems to government-led ones based on the revised Fisheries Act. Future trends should continue to be monitored, as government-led systems have stricter rules that may hamper the socioeconomic incentives described above.

5,"Stroke care in the next decades: A projection derived from a community-based study in Umbria, Italy","Recently published data show that stroke incidence is no longer declining, while case fatality rates has had a less pronunced fall in recent years than in the past. Projections of the increasing number of elderly people, combined with the greater risk of stroke in old age, suggest that in the forthcoming decades we will be faced with an increased request of health resources for patients with stroke. We have therefore used data from a community-based study on stroke incidence and outcome to project the number of first ever strokes, death from stroke and handicap from stroke in Italy, up to the year 2016. Results show that incidence will increase by 22.2%, and death at 6 months from first ever stroke by 29%. However, since patients already handicapped for other reasons are more likely to die from their stroke, the net number of newly handicapped persons will only increased by 5%. These results suggest that in the next decades the major increase in request of health care resources will result from the acute event and the immediate post-ictal phase, and not from the management of chronic handicap after a stroke.

The vegetation in the silvofishery pond consisted of Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, and Avicennia marina. Silvofishery pond was introduced with an area total of 8,484 m2, with an area of 0.4242 ha in each pond of dominated seedlings and saplings, respectively. In the predominated seedling density over sapling showing almost twice found that seedling density consisted of 297 individual/ha which domination of R. apiculata compared to sapling density of 144 individual/ha. Similarly, 726 individual/ha was recorded in the sapling stage, where R. mucronata dominated. Furthermore, the seedling density in the sapling domination ponds for the seedling level was 398 individual/ha. R. mucronata detected in ponds with sapling dominance and seedling domination generally located in the middle part of the pond. By contrast, R. apiculata dominated the seedling level either in the seedlings or saplings stage.

7,"Feasibility and Acceptability of Brighter Bites: A Food Co-Op in Schools to Increase Access, Continuity and Education of Fruits and Vegetables Among Low-Income Populations","Intake of fruits and vegetables (F&V) continues to be low in children in the United States. The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot feasibility evaluation of Brighter Bites, a school-based food co-op to provide access to fresh F&V and nutrition education to low-income children and their families. Brighter Bites is a 16-week school-based food co-op consisting of: (1) Weekly distribution of 50Ã¢â‚¬â€œ60 servings of fresh F&V; (2) Weekly bilingual parent handouts and recipe demonstrations; and (3) implementing CATCH, a coordinated school health program in schools. Brighter Bites was pilot tested using a pre-post evaluation design in one charter school in Houston, TX, USA (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 57 3rd grade parentÃ¢â‚¬â€œchild dyads; 94.1Ã‚Â % Hispanic, 91Ã‚Â % low-income). Evaluation, at baseline, midpoint, and post-intervention, included self-reported child and parent surveys on psychosocial factors, dietary habits and mealtime practices. PearsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chi square test, FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact-test or paired t test were used to determine changes pre- to post-intervention (at pÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.05). Process data using parent surveys, teacher surveys, attendance logs, and produce cost data were used to determine feasibility and acceptability of program. Participants received on average 61 servings of F&V weekly for 16Ã‚Â weeks at the cost of $4.31/family/week. Results showed significant increases in child reported self-efficacy, outcome expectations and attitudes towards consuming F&V (pÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.05). We found significant increases in child exposure to F&V and child preference of various F&V from baseline to post-intervention (pÃ‚Â <Ã‚Â 0.05). Parent surveys showed significant improvements in mealtime practices at home: decrease in children eating while watching TV, increase in eating dinner with the family, less fast food, less sugary drinks with meals, more children asking for F&V as snacks. Process data showed 98Ã‚Â % retention rate and high parent acceptability of program components.

8,"Integrating science and technology to support stream naturalization near Chicago, Illinois","Many urban and suburban communities in the Midwest are seeking to establish sustainable, morphologically and hydraulically varied, yet dynamically stable fluvial systems that are capable of supporting healthy, biologically diverse aquatic ecosystems - a process known as stream naturalization. This paper describes an integrated research program that seeks to develop a scientific and technological framework to support two stream naturalization projects near Chicago, Illinois. The research program integrates theory and methods in fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, hydraulic engineering and social theory. Both the conceptual and the practical challenges of that integration are discussed. Scientific and technical support emphasize the development of predictive tools to evaluate the performance of possible naturalization designs at scales most appropriate to community based projects. Social analysis focuses on place based evaluations of how communities formulate an environmental vision and then, through decision making, translate this vision into specific stream naturalization strategies. Integration of scientific and technical with social components occurs in the context of community based decision making as the predictive tools are employed by project scientists to help local communities translate their environmental visions into concrete environmental designs. Social analysis of this decision making process reveals how the interplay between the community's vision of what they want the watershed to become, and the scientific perspective on what the watershed can become to achieve the community's environmental goals, leads to the implementation of specific stream naturalization practices.",NA,No,"The paper's case study is based in Chicago, Illinois, not in any of the Pacific Island nations specified in the SC."," No; The paper is clearly about a case study in Chicago, Illinois, not any of the listed Pacific Island nations.

9,Trade-offs between conservation and development in community-based management initiatives,"Community-based management (CBM) has attracted much interest as a conservation and development strategy in natural resource-dependent communities in recent decades. However, most initiatives fail to achieve both objectives. The most analyzed CBM strategies in the literature include donor- and govern-ment-driven initiatives, but other types exist as well. The research objective was to identify the internal and external factors that influence the trade-offs between conservation and development in three internally driven CBM initiatives in Latin America: a long-term indigenous-based conservation strategy, the constitutional recognition of ancestral land rights of Afro-American communities and artisanal fisheries management. The results showed that livelihoods depend on natural resources, but none of the cases identified a balance between conservation and development. Community activities are not the primary cause of natural resource degradation. Conservation is supported by ethnicity and cultural values and is challenged by current development models and worldviews that push intensification of resource use and by power asymmetries. Internal pressures include limited rule compliance and enforcement authority to stop free-riding and unauthorized activities. Internal challenges for development include the lack of capacities, rigid rules and non-inclusive CBM, and the inertia and risk aversion that prevail in many communities. External challenges include the lack of economic incentives and compensation models that enable welfare opportunities linked to sustainable management.

11,A model of collaborative programming to address wildlife issues: The northeast wildlife damage management research and outreach cooperative,"Wildlife abundance has grown for several species that are adapted to human-dominated landscapes. Overabundant wildlife may cause nuisance concerns and property damage, or spread zoonotic diseases such as West Nile virus, particularly at the suburban-rural interface of many communities. Consequently, wildlife damage management has become an important component of the wildlife profession. The complicated biological and human dimensions of human-wildlife conflicts often require partnerships between state and federal agencies, universities, local governments, communities, and private wildlife control professionals. The Northeast Wildlife Damage Management Research and Outreach Cooperative (WDM Coop) was formed to enhance coordination and collaboration among wildlife agencies, universities, and other cooperators to promote consistent, multi-state approaches for resolving wildlife-related concerns. During 2001-2004, 12 projects have been funded to examine issues associated with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), black bear (Ursus americanus), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), and beaver (Castor canadensis). These projects have focused on a diverse array topics from community-based efforts to control deer populations, to aversive conditioning techniques for black bears. The Northeast Fish and Wildlife Agency Directors decided to exclude projects focusing on zoonotic diseases and human health issues from the list of WDM Coop activities. There have been focused efforts concerning human dimensions inquiry and outreach publications for wildlife management professionals. As state fish and wildlife agency budgets grow tighter and staff numbers are reduced, we believe more regional centers or wildlife management cooperatives will be formed to meet the increasing demand for services from multiple states with shared issues and concerns.

As a direct result of TAMAR's efforts, the harvest of gravid females and of eggs has ceased in all major nesting areas. The success of the program is based on local participation of the fishing villages, including the employment of former egg poachers to patrol the beaches and protect the nests, education programs, and ecotourism. The majority of stations are staffed year round and not only promote the conservation of endangered sea turtles, but also organize community festivals, support local schools and health care facilities, and assist in developing alternative sources of income for residents who once relied on the exploitation of sea turtles.

14,The renaissance of community-based marine resource management in Oceania,"Twenty-five years ago, the centuries-old Pacific Island practice of community-based marine resource management (CBMRM) was in decline, the victim of various impacts of westernization. During the past two decades, however, this decline has reversed in various island countries. Today CBMRM continues to grow, refuting the claim that traditional non-Western attitudes toward nature cannot provide a sound foundation for contemporary natural resource management. Limited entry, marine protected areas, closed areas, closed seasons, and restrictions on damaging or overly efficient fishing methods are some of the methods being used. Factors contributing to the upsurge include a growing perception of scarcity, the restrengthening of traditional village-based authority, and marine tenure by means of legal recognition and government support, better conservation education, and increasingly effective assistance, and advice from regional and national governments and NGOs.

15,Evaluation of the effectiveness of three underwater reef fish monitoring methods in Fiji,"Locally based and volunteer-based monitoring approaches have recently received greater attention as a cost-effective way to collect data on the environment and/or involve stakeholders in management. The present study compared three monitoring methods based on an underwater visual census (UVC) of reef fish in a customary area in Navakavu (Viti Levu Island, Fiji). Two non-scientific approaches involved (1) snorkellers from the village using vernacular names for five local focal fish taxa and (2) non-resident volunteers using the Reef Check target list of fish for the Indo-Pacific (nine focal taxa). These approaches were cross-checked with a comprehensive scientific survey (all fish recorded at the species level across 12 families). The three methods were compared in terms of accuracy, precision, and ability to highlight changes in fish abundance between the community-managed no-take zone (NTZ) and the fished area. We found that scientific and volunteer-based data were consistent in terms of means and variance of abundance estimates but that Reef Check focal taxa would not be suitable for monitoring the Navakavu marine area. On the contrary, the locally selected target taxa were appropriate but overestimates and imprecision were noticed in the fish counts made by the community members. Differences in abundance of two major target taxa (Lethrinidae and Mullidae) between the NTZ and the harvest area were not validated by the scientific observations. Calibration of community-based UVC is thus needed especially if information from the local biological monitoring program is used to guide management actions.

16,Emergence of co-management governance for Hawai'i coral reef fisheries,"Governance failures associated with top-down management have spawned a myriad of institutional arrangements to engage resource users in decision-making through co-management. Although co-management can take many forms and may not always lead to positive outcomes, it has emerged as a promising governance option available to meet social and ecological goals. Recent research on co-management of small-scale fisheries has used comparative approaches to test factors associated with social and ecological success. Less is known however, about how co-management institutional arrangements emerge and persist in the face of socioeconomic and environmental change. Here, we examine the emergence of co-management governance using a case study from coral reef fisheries in the Hawaiian Islands. We used a mixed methods approach, combining a robust policy analysis and a set of key respondent interviews to trace the evolution of this co-management arrangement. Our research uncovers a set of linked drivers and social responses, which together comprise the emergence phase for the evolution of co-management in this case study. Drivers include resource depletion and conflict, and social responses comprise self-organization, consensus building, and collective action. We share insights on key factors that affect these phases of emergence, drawing on empirical findings from our policy review and key respondent interviews. We conclude by describing ways that our findings can directly inform policy and planning in practice, including the importance of documenting the 'creation story' that spawned the new institutional arrangement, ensuring that enabling conditions are present, the complexity of defining community, the connection between process legitimacy and outcomes, and understanding the costs and timelines associated with co-management governance transitions.

18,Indigenous knowledge in the beach seine fisheries in Sri Lanka: An indispensable factor in community-based fisheries management,"Small-scale fishing over the globe is based primarily on fisher indigenous knowledge (IK), accumulated through many generations of close interactions between people and the natural world. Community-based beach seine fisher communities of southern Sri Lanka were studied through standard ethnographic methods to ascertain the traditional method in using fishers' IK, and explore empirically the accuracy in using those methods distilled from the traditional fishers. Study revealed that, inter alia, traditional fishers use IK to predict the commencement of fishing season, and identify and quantify the species composition occurring at their fishing territory. Ten traditional methods those which are important for identifying and quantifying the fish school were distilled. Explored methods frequently used by traditional fishers were based on the changes of seawater color (folk oceanography) and the behaviour of sea terns (Sterna sp.). Traditional fishers' responses on frequency of utility of explored methods in day-to-day fishing activities were in accordance with the findings of the empirical study. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that PC score loading in fishers' expectation and fishers' realization had a positive significant relationship (r=0.814, p<0.001). This indicated that traditional fishers' expectation on composition and quantity of fish school arriving at fishing territory (ex-ante) is accurate and reliable at the realization (ex-post). As such, there exist opportunities to fisheries co-management for the coastal fisheries in Sri Lanka, incorporating fishers' indigenous knowledge in resource exploitation.

19,Sustainable financing of a national Marine Protected Area network in Fiji,"Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are mostly studied from an environmental context. A review of available information identified a lack of knowledge in sustainable mechanisms to finance MPA networks. At the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2017, Fiji reaffirmed its voluntary commitment to make 30% of its inshore and offshore marine area MPAs by 2020 under Sustainable Development Goal 14. The work presented here uses empirical data to explore potential benefits from selected community-based MPAs to recipient local stakeholders. A Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Willingness to Contribute Time (WtCT) method was used to explore the extent to which bottom-up governance systems represent a potential financing mechanism of a MPA network. Results of 115 interviews concluded that proximity to a fishing market, dependence on marine resources, food security, income and international commitments were significant variables influencing stakeholder's WTP and WtCT to manage a MPA. We argue that there is a discrepancy between WtCT and WTP driven by income constraints. Thus, by using WTP and WtCT to support financing of a MPA network, a Provincial Trust Fund (PTF) could promote an equitable and benefits-based contribution. Equally important, a PTF has a polycentric and decentralized governance model, which endorses sustainable management of traditional fishing communities. The conclusions provide insight into a bottom-up approach for long-term financial sustainability of Fiji's national MPA commitments.

20,"Scaling up of eco-bio-social strategy to control aedes aegypti in highly vulnerable areas in Fortaleza, Brazil: A cluster, non-randomized controlled trial protocol","Aedes aegypti is a cosmopolitan vector for arboviruses dengue, Zika and chikungunya, disseminated in all Brazilian states. The Eco-Bio-Social (EBS) strategy is vital in Aedes aegypti control as it mobilizes stakeholders (government, professionals, society, and academics) to promote healthy environments. This paper describes the rationale and methods of expanding the EBS strategy for Aedes aegypti control in Fortaleza, Northeast Brazil. A cluster, non-randomized controlled clinical trial was developed to analyze the strategyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effectiveness in vulnerable territories (high incidence of dengue and violent deaths; low HDI; substandard urban infrastructure, high population density, and water scarcity). We selected two intervention and two control groups, resulting in a sample of ap-proximately 16,000 properties. The intervention consisted of environmental management by sealing large elevated water tanks, introduction of beta fish in waterholes, elimination of potential breeding sites, and mobilization and training of schoolchildren, endemic disease workers, health workers, social mobilizers, and community leaders; community surveillance of arboviruses; construction and validation of a booklet for the prevention of arboviruses in pregnant women. We analyzed the costs of arboviruses to government and households, the intervention cost-effectiveness, chikungunyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chronicity, and acceptance, sustainability, and governance of vector control actions. The primary outcome (infestation) was analyzed using the house, container, and Breteau indices. We hope that this study will help us understand how to scale up strategies to fight Aedes aegypti in vulnerable areas. Ã‚Â© 2021 by the authors.

21,Differential impacts of coral reef herbivores on algal succession in Kenya,"In shallow-water systems, fisheries management influences herbivory, which mediates ecosystem processes by regulating algal biomass, primary production, and competition between benthic organisms, such as algae and corals. Sea urchins and herbivorous fishes (scrapers, grazers, browsers) are the dominant herbivores in Kenya's fringing coral reef and their grazing influences coral-macroalgal dynamics and dominance. Using experimental substrata and grazer exclusions, we tested the hypothesis that herbivores differentially affect algal composition and succession using 3 levels of fisheries management: fished reefs, community-managed closures (&lt;10 yr old, &lt;0.5 km2), and government-managed closures (20 to 40 yr old, 5 to 10 km2). In fished reefs and government closures, herbivores facilitated maintenance of early successional algal species, such as turfs, associated with sea urchins in the former and scraping fishes in the latter. Crustose coralline algae were only abundant in government closures, and video recordings showed that fish grazing was greatest at these sites, most notably for parrotfishes (scrapers). A combination of sea urchins and small grazing and detritivorous fishes was present in community closures, which allowed macroalgae to quickly develop from turf into early then late successional stages. These reefs may represent an intermediate or transitional system of herbivore dominance characterized by macroalgae. Consequently, reefs in heavily fished seascapes initially protected from fishing may require additional management efforts to facilitate the recovery of larger-bodied scraping fishes, including bans on capturing parrotfishes and restricting gear (e.g. spearguns) that target these species.

22,Characterization of an artisanal fishery in Argentina using the social-ecological systems framework,"Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) studies how institutions (the rules of the game of a society) determine the performance of a social-economic system. Elinor Ostrom extends the institutional analysis to the collective action for a particular case, the study of the social-ecological systems (SESs) (Ostrom 1990). Any group that attempts to manage a common resource (e.g. aquifers, pastures) for optimal sustainable production must solve a set of problems in order to create institutions to facilitate collective action. Some evidences show that following a set of design principles in creating institutions can lead to overcome these problems. The aim of the paper is to apply the SES framework to an artisanal fishery community in Argentina in order to: 1) describe the principal features, key variables and relations of the small-scale fishery system; 2) detect the principal drivers of a potential common-management and the leading detractors from the current communal performance; and 3) analyze the possibility that a self-governing for sustainable fishery may appear. Several drivers for potential common-management and some detractors from the current common performance are summarized. Artisanal fishery SES is currently at a bifurcation point. A common historical and cultural root, the presence of leaderships, the relevance of local knowledge, the dependence on the resource to sustainable livelihoods and the threat of big-scale fisheries area have generated incentives to collectiveaction. But, simultaneously, internal conflicts are the most important barrier for an integrated community-based management. The heterogeneity among actors and the relevant external conditions have resulted in two groups diverging in their self-organization. The work is framed by the project COMET-LA (COmmunitybased Management of Environmental challenges in Latin America; European CommissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Seventh Framework Programme of Research and Development), which aims to identify sustainable community-based governance for the management of natural resources that can be used in different social-ecological systems in a context of climate change and increasing competition in the use of resources.

23,Application of the Ostrom framework in the analysis of a social-ecological system with multiple resources in a marine protected area,"The framework proposed by Ostrom (2009) has become one of the most utilized tools to address the complexity of social-ecological systems. Most cases use this framework to analyze the systems from the perspective of a single resource unit. However, the livelihoods in several coastal communities are diverse, so that the users interact with multiple common-pool resources, which makes their analysis difficult. In this sense, it is important to identify the key elements of management to achieve the sustainable use of the resources. In this study, we were able to do this in a coastal community where commercial fishing, ecotourism, and recreational fishing coexist. The system of interest, located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was subdivided by resource type using a multi-method approach to data collection including surveys, interviews, and records review. A conceptual map was developed that shows how the second-tier variables are integrated through the governance and actors with the biophysical system. The actors involved in lobster fishing achieved a more complex governance system, followed by the ecotourism and recreational fishing; the complexity of the governance was related with the equity level of the actors. The analysis revealed the research gaps to develop management strategies and improve the sustainability of the system.

24,Participation towards heritage conservation: Case of a fishing community in Langkawi Geopark,"There is an increasing movement towards acceptance of public participation as a logical approach to heritage conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. In conservation initiatives, to ensure effective participation is to see it as a social process. Thus, the importance of community participation and consultation in planning for heritage conservation is emphasised using an example from fishing community involvement in community-based fisheries management in Langkawi. The setting up of cooperative community resource management Komuniti Pengurusan Ekosistem Perikanan (KPEP) is a significant attempt that acknowledges the value of local involvement in natural resource management. It aims to understand local fishers' participation in resource management activities towards heritage conservation. One of the findings revealed that although the resource management activities did not mentioned explicitly the importance of heritage conservation. However it could be assumed that intention for heritage conservation is at the heart of the initiatives. Implicit in such an approach is a sense that local fishers' participation in managing resources would utilise local knowledge gained from past down traditions of previous generations. The application of local knowledge encourages them to become aware of their fishing cultural heritage and to encourage them to conserve it. It is crucial for development activities surrounding the area of KPEP Kuala Teriang are compatible and complementary to the existing activities of fisheries heritage conservation and promotion of social well-being.

25,Evolving governance structures in community-based sandfish mariculture and their interactions with livelihood outcomes: Evidence from the Philippines,"Sea cucumber mariculture is an important emerging field of practice and applied research in the coastal tropics. This is due to the existing importance of tropical sea cucumber fisheries for wealth generation and poverty reduction, and the potential for mariculture to contribute to the longer term sustainability of these fisheries while generating benefits additional to those from wild caught sea cucumber. Understanding the optimal institutional arrangements for sea cucumber mariculture is an important area of focus in this field, with a variety of arrangements currently in place. This paper documents the establishment of a communal form of sea ranching in the Philippines, as a case study of community level institutional processes. It describes the background to establishment of the sea ranch in the community of Victory, challenges encountered and how these were managed, and the evolution of governance arrangements. In charting this process, we assess the impacts on livelihood outcomes, highlighting this as a crucial aspect influencing this evolution and the nature of community involvement in the sea ranch. While the sea ranching project generated a range of benefits for livelihoods, including possible spillover effects for the surrounding fishery, substantial economic returns from harvests did not occur. Thus, the system of governing the sea ranch evolved from a communal model to a more exclusive household model primarily to improve operational efficiency. In order for possible benefits of the sea ranch to be sustained and enhanced, greater integration with fisheries management and government support will be needed.

26,Placing Madagascar's marine turtle populations in a regional context using community-based monitoring,"Madagascar is an important foraging ground for marine turtles in the Western Indian Ocean, yet the status of the country's nesting aggregations remains poorly documented. We assess the current status and trend in nesting throughout Madagascar, including data recorded by a community-based monitoring project in the Barren Isles (western Madagascar). We contextualize the findings in comparison with data from Madagascar's closest neighbouring states. Reports indicate that nesting levels have declined at many coastal sites, with no known recordings since 2000 at > 40 nesting sites. We estimate there are a minimum of 1,200 nests per year in Madagascar, with the largest recorded nesting aggregation (< 1,000 nests per year) found on islands off the west and northern coasts. The majority of nesting aggregations, including those recorded by the community-based monitoring project in the Barren Isles, are relatively small, in the order of < 50 nests per year, yet they are potentially important sources of regional genetic diversity. Nesting on many of the islands (e.g. Tromelin, Europa) around Madagascar has increased over the last 20 years, despite the fact that thousands of turtles probably originating from these sites are taken by fishers in the waters of Madagascar annually. We discuss the importance of protecting small nesting populations, and how community-based monitoring could be an important tool for conserving remote and vulnerable populations and building capacity for natural resource management.

27,25th anniversary invited paper trends in development of coastal area management in tropical countries: From central to community orientation,"The development phases of coastal management in tropical countries are described. Precolonial, centralized, community based, and collaborative coastal management are identified as forms of management which have evolved to what today is called integrated coastal management. Centralized management began during colonial times when any attempt at management was orchestrated from the top of government. Community based coastal management, in response to the failures of more centralized approaches, began in the Philippines through several projects, the experience of which spread to other countries in Southeast Asia and to Ecuador in the 1980s. The concept of collaborative management is now accepted as a description of variations in joint management arrangements between government and community or with the private sector stakeholders. It is suggested that collaborative management and integrated coastal management are more or less synonymous. The trends identified within tropical coastal management include interdisciplinary research and management integration, valuing traditional knowledge and management systems, increasing reliance on local participation, and using participation oriented research approaches. It is seen that the capacity for improved coastal management is increasing dramatically with a strong emphasis on training through academe and field learning trials. The authors are positive about current developments in coastal management, while cautioning practitioners that global economics will increasingly impact the use and conservation of coastal resources. A theme is that local government and community accountability in coastal management will help make efforts effective and more sustainable.

We assessed local livelihood assets in Kampong Phluk Community before and after the introduction of the community-based ecotourism (CBET) governance system, where it was previously under the private company management system (SEAPAC). We used a sustainable livelihood framework to assess natural, physical, human, social, and financial assets by analyzing a set of panel data of 150 observations according to the scoring scale of zero (total dissatisfaction) to one (total satisfaction). We found that full implementation of CBET raised the overall average score of livelihood assets by 0.15. In particular, physical capital and human capital achieved remarkable growth by 0.25 to 0.23, respectively, while growth in natural capital and financial capital was statistically insignificant. Although CBET showed promising results, improving communication and providing community health care would motivate active participation in ecotourism development.

29,"Loco or no loco? Holocene climatic fluctuations, human demography, and community based management of coastal resources in Northern Chile","The abundance of the southern Pacific mollusk loco (Concholepas concholepas), among other conspicuous marine supplies, are often cited as critical resources behind the long-term cultural and demographic fluctuations of prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the coastal Atacama Desert. These societies inhabited one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most productive marine environments flanked by one the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s driest deserts. Both of these environments have witnessed significant ecological variation since people first colonized themat the end of the Pleistocene (c. 13,000 cal yr BP). Here, we examine the relationship between the relative abundance of shellfish (a staple resource) along a 9,500-year sequence of archeological shell midden accumulations at Caleta (a small inlet or cove) Vitor, with past demographic trends (established via summed probability distributions of radiocarbon ages) and technological innovations together with paleoceanographic data on past primary productivity. We find that shellfish extraction varied considerably from one cultural period to the next in terms of the number of species and their abundance, with diversity increasing during periods of regionally decreased productivity. Such shifts in consumption patterns are considered community based management decisions, and for the most part they were synchronous with large and unusual regional demographic fluctuations experienced by prehistoric coastal societies in northern Chile. When taken together with their technological innovations, our data illustrates how these human groups tailored their socio-cultural patterns to what were often abrupt and prolonged environmental changes throughout the Holocene.

30,Multi-scale policy diffusion and translation in Pacific Island coastal fisheries,"Multilateral consensus forged among heads of states must be value-additive and relevant at the national level to facilitate on-ground implementation. Yet, despite general optimism and advances in policy understanding, multi-scale diffusion remains a challenge with little certainty in outcomes. This study focuses on examining intermediary dynamics occurring within national policy apparatus that can influence domestic uptake of policy innovation. We analyse the anticipated spread of two supranational policies on coastal fisheries in the Pacific region Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the 'small-Scale Fisheries GuidelinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe New SongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in three countries: Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Our approach combines instrumental perspectives on Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpolicy coherenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œnormative perspectives on Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpolicy imageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Accordingly, we use two methods: a document-based comparison of the policies produced at different levels and interviews with national government officers in charge of policy deliberation and delivery. We find supranational-to-national policy coherence across most prescribed policy themes, except for emergent social themes such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœgenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhuman rightsÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased approachesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The views of government managers substantiate, and further augment, this finding. Crucially, managers' images (encompassing judgements, aspirations and convictions) represent personal and practical attributes involved in policy interpretation and implementation. Multi-scale policy diffusion is thus a translational process mediated by national-level staff, and managers' policy images offer nuanced and dynamic insights into why some policies are slow to take root while others take different shape to their agreed meanings. Analysts and policymakers must consider and mobilise translational approaches and policy images in order to understand and facilitate successful domestic implementation of international agreements.

32,"Assessment of ecological vulnerability to climate variability on coastal fishing communities: A study of Ungwana Bay and Lower Tana Estuary, Kenya","Fisheries resources are important in supporting the livelihood of many coastal communities especially in the developing tropical countries. Fisheries resources however, continue to face unprecedented pressure from the impacts of climate change, and this presents both ecological and socio-economic challenges to the dependent communities. This paper assessed the ecological vulnerability to climate variability of artisanal fishing communities in Ungwana Bay and the Lower Tana Delta in Kenya, using selected fin fish species. A combination of approaches were adopted and used to identify and determine exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation indicators. These included a critical review of existing literature, socio-economic survey, and computation of temperature and rainfall variation using long term data from 1983 to 2015. The method of Equal Weights (EW) was applied to all indicators after normalization. The data was normalized in a scale of 0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1, where 0 indicated low vulnerability level and 1 high vulnerability. By using composite index, the selected Ngomeni and Ozi fishing communities within the larger Ungwana Bay and Lower Tana Delta indicated high levels of vulnerability of 0.9 and 0.8 respectively. Due to high vulnerability level and poor adaptation capacity by the local fishing communities in the selected study sites, we recommend government and non-governmental agencies to reinforce community based organizations (CBOs) activities on ecological conservation and social network creation to promote short and long term adaptation measures.

33,The Ghosts of Fisheries Management,"The scientific analysis and management of fisheries has been dominated by three institutional orthodoxies: state regulation, market exchange and community-based management. This paper argues that these static, substantive, metaphors obscure a consideration of the dynamic temporal interplay between stakeholders and their environment. To address this vacuity the paper outlines a process-sociological approach and applies it to the historical development of fisheries management in the Tam Giang Lagoon, in Central Vietnam. The analysis shows that the interplay between different groups of fishers, the Vietnamese state, and the lagoon environment, over time, structures future struggles. As such, this interplay needs to be understood as a causal force of its own in the development of fisheries management.

35,Lessons for modern management from the South Pacific,"A traditional Pacific islands coastal resource management system is a community-based, participatory system for the integrated management of both land and sea. It is an expression of social relationships between people, expressed as rights to exploit resources. It is an area in which traditional or customary fishing rights are exercised as part of a land-sea area which a particular group, related through kinship, collectively owns. There may be another group associated with that ""primary' group which has rights of use in the area. These rights are bound by unwritten management rules. Traditional South Pacific islander fisheries management systems have long included many progressive elements of ""western' fisheries management, including limited entry; seasonal, spatial, gear, size, and species restrictions; prior appropriation rights; and the concept of sole ownership, among others.

37,Classification of coastal communities reporting commercial fish landings in the U.S. Northeast region: Developing and testing a methodology,"The National Marine Fisheries Service is required by law to conduct social impact assessments of communities impacted by fishery management plans. To facilitate this process, we developed a technique for grouping communities based on common sociocultural attributes. Multivariate data reduction techniques (e.g. principal component analyses, cluster analyses) were used to classify Northeast U.S. fishing communities based on census and fisheries data. The comparisons indicate that the clusters represent real groupings that can be verified with the profiles. We then selected communities representative of different values on these multivariate dimensions for in-depth analysis. The derived clusters are then compared based on more detailed data from fishing community profiles. Ground-truthing (e.g. visiting the communities and collecting primary information) a sample of communities from three clusters (two overlapping geographically) indicates that the more remote techniques are sufficient for typing the communities for further in-depth analyses.

38,Fijian villagers adapt to changes in local fisheries,"This paper analyzes some of the problems encountered by a village-run fishing cooperative in rural Fiji. Concern about the limited success of this fishing cooperative led the villagers of Kaba Point. Fiji to ask for biological and socioeconomic studies to determine the roots of the cooperative's problems. The villagers also required an assessment of their proposal to revitalize the cooperative through a development scheme that would enable them to increase their catch. The surveys, undertaken by researchers from the University of the South Pacific and the Fiji Fisheries Division, indicate that the area has been overfished, primarily through the widespread local and commercial use of gillnets and the reliance on fishing as a sole source of village income, and further expansion of the current resource exploitation patterns would be very damaging. In addition, although the cooperative provides an important sense of communalism in the village, only a few people regularly provide fish to the coop. The semi-subsistence lifestyle of rural Fiji is one factor limiting villagers participation in full-time fishing activities. The traditional social and management structures inherent in this village (especially, marine tenure, chiefly responsibility for the community, and a demonstrated history of communal projects) can form a strong basis for a modern community-based marine management program. However, if not carefully watched, resources can also be locally mismanaged because of the increasing demands of the modern market-driven economy.This paper analyzes some of the problems encountered by a village-run fishing cooperative in rural Fiji.

41,Evaluation of the Impact of a Pharmacist-Led Telehealth Clinic on Diabetes-Related Goals of Therapy in a Veteran Population,"Objectives Telemedicine has been offered as a way to ensure that all patients, including those who live in rural areas, have access to the same health care. This study was performed to evaluate the benefit of a real-time, clinic-based video telehealth (Clinical Video Telehealth [CVT]) program and the impact of a pharmacist-led CVT clinic for chronic disease state management. The primary objective was to evaluate changes from baseline values, in veterans referred by primary care providers to this clinic. Methods This was a single-center, prospective, pre-post pilot study that also included a post-patient satisfaction survey. The study was conducted at the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, which is composed of two medical centers and 12 community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) located away from the two main facilities. Fifteen clinical pharmacy specialists (CPSs) - seven at the two main facilities and eight at the CBOCs - provide disease state management clinical pharmacy services. One of the seven CPSs at the main facilities works via telemedicine and provides services to the CBOCs where on-site clinical pharmacy services did not exist. The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in A1C, LDL level, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure after 6 months of CVT services by the CPS. Secondary outcomes were the percentages of patients meeting American Diabetes Association treatment goals for hemoglobin A1c (A1C), low-density lipoprotein level, and blood pressure, both individually and in combination after attending a pharmacist-led CVT program; the level of patient satisfaction with pharmacists' care and with CVT as a method of receiving chronic disease management, specifically for diabetes; and medication additions or changes made by the pharmacist. Results Twenty-six patients completed the 6-month evaluation. A significant decrease in A1C of 2% from baseline was observed (p=0.0002), and the percentage of patients meeting goal A1C significantly increased from 0% at baseline to 38% at 6 months (p=0.0007). Overall patient satisfaction scores were also high, with a median score 39.5 (interquartile range 36-40) of a maximum score of 40. Conclusion Six months of CVT clinic attendance significantly improved A1C values and the overall percentage of patients meeting their goal A1C values in this veteran population. In addition, patient satisfaction scores also indicated a high level of satisfaction with the pharmacist-led CVT service. Ã‚Â© Published 2016.

42,Modeling short-term fishing dynamics in a small-scale intertidal shellfishery,"We assessed the relative contribution of a set of predictors on the short-term dynamics of the yellow clam intertidal fishery in Uruguay based on a community-based data collection program for five consecutive fishing seasons. Results of generalized linear mixed models showed that the occurrence of fishable days depends on the absence of red tide events and prevailing wind conditions, but also was related to the timing of each fishing event throughout the fishing season. Furthermore, higher fishing yields were coincident with the prevalence of northerly offshore winds. Catch per unit of effort levels of each fishing event were mostly related to interannual characteristics of each fishing season and, to a lesser extent, with fisher attributes (gender and age) and the timing of each fishing event. The adverse effect of red tides and unfavorable environmental conditions impose a high degree of uncertainty in this social-ecological system, leading to economic inefficiency. A key challenge for successful management of the yellow clam fishery and other similar small-scale fisheries relies in considering not only the resource and the governance subsystems, but also the dynamics of the resource users, together with relevant external drivers affecting them.

43,Long-Term Stability of the Faunal Community of a Subtropical Estuary: Evaluating Disturbances in the Context of Interannual Variability,"Estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems can have significant intra- and interannual variability in faunal community structure, complicating management response to disturbances as disturbance effects must be detectable within normal variability and on timescales relevant to management entities. We examined a long-term, multi-gear dataset on estuarine faunal (fish and select invertebrate) communities to determine if community structure changes due to disturbances could be detected on management-relevant timescales (e.g., years), given that these communities have known seasonal and interannual variability. Results from multivariate, community-based analyses, and several univariate diversity indices for fauna of Tampa Bay, Florida, USA suggested general community stability over the long term, with the exceptions of 2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006 (prolonged red tide event) and 2010 (extreme cold event in winter). Community structure was notably outside the typical variability for both time periods. In 2005, species richness decreased by half for one gear type and was the lowest on record for the other two gear types. In 2010, when the relative abundance of a top predator decreased by 50% from cold-related mortality, SimpsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diversity index was the lowest on record for one gear type. The red tide and extreme-cold events differed in duration and the number of taxa directly impacted (multispecies vs. single-species, respectively) but both multivariate and univariate analyses indicated significant deviation in the faunal community structure during these years. Within 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3Ã‚Â years after these major events, however, the community seemed to have returned to a structure like that of previous years, suggesting long-term stability and resilience. Our results confirm that multivariate and univariate analyses can detect major disturbances to estuarine faunal communities, which gives management entities options for which analysis approach is appropriate for their needs. Since the Tampa Bay faunal communities recovered within 3Ã‚Â years, we suggest that where long-term monitoring exists, active restoration might be deferred while monitoring for signs of recovery following the removal of a perturbation. This is a fundamental part of sound adaptive management processes to promote sustainable ecosystems.

44,Exclusive economic zones and the management of fisheries in the South China Sea,"The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), with the provisions for defining an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), is the international agreement that has had the greatest influence on the structure of fisheries policies in national and international arenas. It had the profound effect of increasing the contribution of fisheries to the national gross domestic product or GDP. It brought about a redistribution of benefits from fishing from distant water fishing fleets to the coastal states. Investments flowed in to the fisheries sector. Countries that had fisheries resources but limited capacity to exploit them established joint ventures with states that owned fishing fleets (ADB, 1997). The end result was a substantial increase in the contribution of fisheries to the national GDP especially in developing countries and the overall shift in total capture fisheries production from the developed to the developing world (Delgado et al., 2003). The LOSC and the EEZ are strongly associated with ownership and the implication that fisheries will be better managed within some property rights regime. These concepts were modified by coastal states to apply to fisheries management policies at the scale of local governments and even communities. Shortly after the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended in 1982, community-based initiatives to define fishing rights and effectively manage fisheries proliferated. There was a stronger effort to move national policy toward devolution of fisheries management to local government units and encourage co-management and stakeholder participation in the management of coastal resources. There were several efforts to develop Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Plans and establish Community Based Coastal Resource Management (CBCRM) strategies in the Philippines first, and later in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. In this paper, we present case studies where there is a poor institutional fit between the EEZs of coastal states and the natural structure of fisheries resources. This has led to the formulation of inadequate fisheries policies, difficulties in monitoring and controlling the overexploitation of fish stocks, and a massive degradation of fish habi tats vital to the survival and sustainability of stocks. In the first two decades of the LOSC, states have focused on implementing Articles 55-56 and 61-62, which detailed their jurisdiction and right to exploit resources optimally. In this next decade of implementing the LOSC, states will need to consider the provisions for transboundary cooperation detailed in Articles 63 to 67 of Part V of the LOSC. We highlight the importance of knowledge of institutional interplay in fisheries management at the local, sub-national, national and regional scales, and how this relates to the structure of fish stocks and national jurisdiction. We also suggest some research priorities and institutional adjustments required to increase the chances of devising a successful fisheries policy, embody a broader regional perspective of the needs and aspirations of fisheries, as well as national goals. The case studies presented are derived from the experiences of coastal states that border the South China Sea. Ã‚Â© 2005 Springer.

45,Facing limits in oceanic fisheries: Part I: Extent of the problem and policy responses,"Research from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and fishery scientists indicates that the wild catch offish and other marine life from the oceans will not be able to increase significantly in the future, except through rehabilitation and better management of stocks. Despite the limited potential for bigger catches, fishing fleets have expanded rapidly in recent decades under government subsidies. Fishers now have approximately twice the capacity necessary to make the annual catch from the oceans. The juxtaposition of natural limits and overinvestment has created a crisis situation for the world's fishers, fishing communities and traditional fishing cultures. Part I of this article discusses policy responses at the national and international level. How policy makers respond to the overextension of the marine fishing industry will determine the extent of job loss, hunger and dislocation that will result. Part II, to be published in the Forum's next issue (February 1995), will examine the social aspects of the world's fishing industry, including the demography of fishers, utilization of fisheries products, the relative social contribution of aquaculture and policy responses to overcapacity.

We recorded 14 breeding pairs inside and 13 outside T-M PA. The T-M PA and surrounding habitat hosted respectively 10 and six breeding polyandrous pairs, composed of one adult female and two adult males. During the six-year study period, 101 eggs were laid in nests in T-M PA of which 60 hatched and 58 young fledged. We recorded 62 eggs laid in nests outside the T-M PA of which 39 hatched and 36 young fledged. Productivity was similar at both sites, inside and outside T-M PA, with 0.84 (58/69) and 0.76 (36/47) fledgling per nesting attempt and 0.69 (58/84) and 0.5 (36/72) fledglings per territorial pair, respectively. Polyandrous pairs have higher productivity compared with normal pairs. Threats to Madagascar Fish Eagles and their habitat were low due to the existence of a community-based resource management system called the Local Management Secured System (GELOSE) inside and outside the T-M PA.

47,Hidden benefits and risks of partial protection for coral reef fisheries,"Partially protected areas are now the dominant global form of spatial management aimed at preserving ecosystem integrity and managing human use. However, most evaluations of their efficacy use only a narrow set of conservation indicators that reflect a fraction of ways in which protection can succeed or fail. In this paper, we examine three case studies of partially protected coral reef fishery systems to evaluate benefits and risks of their use as a management tool. We use data from community-based management arrangements in three Pacific Island countries to demonstrate three vignettes of how partial protection can boost fisheries production, enhance the ease with which fishers catch their prey, and alter the composition of fisheries yields. These changes in fisheries productivity, catchability, and vulnerability under partial protection carry substantial benefits for fishers. However, they also carry significant risks for ecosystems and fisheries livelihoods unless adaptively managed so as to confer the short to medium term benefits in resource performance without risking longer term sustainability.

48,A theory of scaling for community-based fisheries management,"Community-based approaches to fisheries management has emerged as a mainstream strategy to govern dispersed, diverse and dynamic small scale fisheries. However, amplifying local community led sustainability outcomes remains an enduring challenge. We seek to fill a theoretical gap in the conceptualization of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœscaling up community-based fisheries managementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. We draw on literature of agriculture innovations to provide a framework that takes into account process-driven and structural change occurring across multiple levels of governance, as well as different phases of scaling. We hypothesize that successful scaling requires engagement with all aspects of a governing regime, coalescing a range of actors, and therefore, is an enterprise that is larger than its parts.

49,Assessment of governance of fisher communities of inland openwater fisheries in Bangladesh,"The Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) with partnership arrangement of government, non-government organisations, fisher communities and other stakeholders has introduced community management of inland openwater fisheries in Bangladesh. This arrangement introduced CBFM approaches named fisher-led, community-led and women-led approach. One of the principles behind community based managed fisheries is to improve democratisation process of changing governance of fisheries aiming to manage their resources efficiently. The CBFM approach has made a significant contribution towards improvement of governance and democracy to fisher communities. Besides, a wider range of local institutional arrangements as community based organizations (CBOs) have been established through participatory process with legal entity. Now, there is practice of governance and democracy within CBOs and fisher communities. They are more efficient in participation of fisheries management.

50,"Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia: A perspective on its transborder hydrological and resources governance","Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in South East Asia, being situated at the heart of the Mekong River Basin. Governance of the lake over the recent past has been weak and overly complex, and the basin governance structure has changed over time in terms of its fisheries management framework. The governance framework initially focused on the commercial exploitation of fish resources, but has more recently switched to a community-based fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and open access model. This study discusses how the water flows occurring between the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake complicate the governance of the lake, and particularly its fisheries, biodiversity, land and water management activities. The establishment of the Tonle Sap Authority (TSA) in 2007 sought to address the governance challenges facing the lake. The current study concludes, however, that the TSA alone is not sufficient and that global, regional and national stakeholders must make an effort to ensure the water flows between the lake and the Mekong River are themselves considered a core governance issue for the Tonle Sap.

51,The difference that class makes: Neoliberalization and non-capitalism in the fishing industry of new england,"Fishing economies are typically represented as pre-capitalist and as a barrier to capital accumulation rather than as an alternative economy with its own potentials. Privatization (and capitalism) appears logical and inevitable because ""there is no alternative"" described or given. The class analysis presented here focuses on questions of property and subjectivity and describes fishing as a non-capitalist and community-based economy consonant with both a tradition of common property and an image of ""fishermen"" as independent and interested in fairness and equity. While the latter is associated with a neoliberal subject aligned with the capitalist economy, a class analysis of fishing repositions ""fishermen"" as community subjects aligned with a community economy.

52,CROI 2016: Hot spots in HIV infection and advances in HIV prevention,"The 2016 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) highlighted hot spots in HIV infection. Men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender populations, people who inject drugs, fisherfolk, migrants, adolescents, and older adults are heavily impacted in a number of regions. Stigma contributes to risk behaviors and HIV acquisition across populations. HIV testing is a crucial first step in the HIV care continuum, and several large community-based surveys are underway in Africa to increase HIV testing, linkage to care, and uptake of antiretroviral treatment. Advances in preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) featured prominently at CROI 2016. Two large efficacy trials of a vaginal ring containing the investigational drug dapivirine demonstrated efficacy and safety in preventing HIV infections in women in Africa. Data on the safety of long-acting injectable PrEP and several investigational PrEP drugs and formulations were also presented. Knowledge and use of PrEP among MSM in the United States appears to be increasing, and high uptake was seen among black MSM when provided as part of a culturally tailored support program. The use of broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV prevention is a novel and promising approach to be evaluated in efficacy trials. Ã‚Â© 2016, IASÃ¢â‚¬â€œUSA.

Special attention is paid to community-based organic agriculture as a pathway to rural development. The Philippines has two decades of experience of community-based natural resource management. Unlike public natural resources such as forests, watersheds or fisheries, however, the community-based organic agriculture programme is intended to deal with the private property regime. Thus, if the programme is to be successful, agrarian land reform must continue. Integrated rice- duck farming is among the suitable and viable options for organic agriculture, given that rice is a major agricultural crop and duck meat is popular in the Philippines.

57,A role for partially protected areas on coral reefs: Maintaining fish diversity?,"Completely banning fishing from coral reefs is now accepted to have significant benefits for marine biodiversity and in many cases, fisheries. However, the benefits of regulating fishing on coral reefs, by restricting the methods used, or the total amount of fishing, are less well understood, even though such regulations are much more likely to be supported by fishermen. This study assesses whether banning illegal, destructive fishing methods and reducing the numbers of fishermen visiting from outside an area benefits a coral reef fishery, despite unregulated fishing by local fishermen using non-destructive methods. The abundance, biomass, mean length, and species richness of nine commercially important fish families are compared across ten independent patch reefs inside and outside the 470km2 Menai Bay Conservation Area in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Even after taking into account the effect of differences in habitat and the distance between reefs, 61% (Ã‚Â±19.7%) more fish species were found in regulated than unregulated reefs. Fish abundance, biomass, and length were not affected, suggesting that banning destructive fishing may improve biodiversity, but that further regulations may be required to improve fish stocks.

58,Coastal resources management planning and implementation for the Fishery Sector Program of the Philippines,"This paper explains the methods being used to plan for and implement a coastal resources management (CRM) component of the Fishery Sector Program (FSP) for the Philippines. The FSP, supported by the Asian Development Bank and implemented by the Department of Agriculture, intends to generate CRM plans through site-specific planning processes and to implement these plans through local government and nongovernment participation. The FSP has six components which are complementary and partly overlapping, these are: fishery resource and ecological assessments; CRM in twelve priority bays; law enforcement; research and extension; credit to promote alternative livelihood options; and fisheries-related infrastructure improvement. The CRM component, which has implications for most of the other components, is being initially implemented in three bays as pilot sites for the FSP. CRM planning entails resource, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural, legal and institutional assessments for management. Formulation of CRM plans is through local government, communities and nongovernment organizations as facilitated by Departments of Agriculture, and Environment and Natural Resources field offices with guidance from the Project Management Office and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Manila. Strategies for the implementation of the CRM plans typically involve the use of community-based resource management schemes.

59,Transformations of Vietnamese shrimp aquaculture policy: Empirical evidence from the Mekong Delta,"International environmental and social concerns about tropical shrimp production have led to the emergence of private transnational governance and regulation. Using cases from Ca Mau we investigate how the shift to private transnational regulatory networks has changed the role of the government from a regulator to a facilitator of global private governance interests and arrangements. The rise of these various schemes has also been part of a shift from quantitative to qualitative policy goals within the Vietnamese aquaculture sector. In turn, this has led to new internal relationships, most notably the repositioning of private interests and community-based management within the Vietnamese state framework. We conclude that the ongoing transformation of the government's role in environmental shrimp governance requires mechanisms that foster improved participation and compliance between the state and private actors. To achieve this efforts are needed to better include local government at both communal and village levels and to use existing global market incentives more strategically.

62,Sri Lankan reservoir fishery: A case for introduction of a co-management strategy,"The inland fisheries of Sri Lanka are essentially artisanal on most of the reservoirs in the country. The annual inland fish production declined dramatically after 1990, when state patronage for the development of the inland fisheries was discontinued for 4 years. This decline was shown to be a result of growth overfishing of the two dominant cichlid species which accounted for over 90% of landings. This was a result of using small mesh (<6.9 cm) gillnets in the absence of the State-sponsored monitoring procedure in the fishery after 1990. This indicates that it is necessary to monitor inland fisheries management in Sri Lanka through a centralized authority in the current situation. However, in some Sri Lankan reservoirs, fishing communities can be categorized as 'organized' because they collectively make decisions to define procedures for the rational exploitation of the fishery resources. In reservoirs with 'organized' fishing, the communities themselves have developed mechanisms tto regulate the landing sizes of dominant cichlid fish species through community-based fisheries management strategies. In such reservoirs, over-exploitation of fish stocks was not evident, even after 1990, when state-sponsored monitoring procedures were suspended. Based on these observations, an alternative approach is recommended for the management of Sri Lankan reservoir capture fisheries in which the Government and resource-users have equal responsibilities in the management of the resources.",NA,No,"The case study is based in Sri Lanka, not in any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is clearly about a case study in Sri Lanka, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

63,"Will small MPAs work?: The case of small-sized MPAs in Southern Iloilo, Philippines","Most of the marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Philippines are small-sized and community-based, and their contribution to the conservation efforts have been usually overlooked. This paper will present the results of the biological assessment study conducted in three community-based MPAs in Southern Iloilo, Philippines. Each MPA has a 2-ha no-take zone and this size is way below the recommended optimal size of 10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ100Ã‚Â km2. Results show that fish biomass showed an overall increase of about 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5 times.

Macroepifaunal abundance increased 2 to 8 times across the three MPA sites. However, live hard coral cover showed a parallel Ã¢Ë†Â¼40% decrease across all sites, which can be attributed to several factors. The conservation goals of these MPAs have been attained.

64,One size does not fit all: Critical insights for effective community-based resource management in Melanesia,"In recent years, Fiji's approach of combining traditional systems of community-based coastal management and modern management systems has become a successful blueprint for marine conservation, particularly the Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) network model. As a result of this success, conservation practitioners have imported the Fiji LMMA model to the Solomon Islands and in Vanuatu in hope of replicating the purported success attained in Fiji. This paper argues that because tenure systems and associated political systems in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are substantially different, one cannot simply extrapolate the more centralized tenurial and political Fiji model to the decentralized tenurial and politically eclectic Solomons and Vanuatu. This paper provides an analysis of some of the various approaches used in these countries to make a case for why socio-political diversity and historical particulars matter to resource management and conservation-in-practice (and for any development interventions). By examining examples of various nested and polycentric governance approachesÃ¢â‚¬â€family, community, tribal, confederations, local community-based organizations (CBOs), and ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â€it elucidates not only some of the differences between Fiji and Solomon Islands/Vanuatu, but also between Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. This provides critical insights into some of the myriad of factors impinging on conservation aspirations in these countries and may offer some alternative ways forward not currently considered by conservation practitioners. Finally, the paper provides some guidelines to how to increase the long-term success of marine conservation programs for fisheries management and community-based management initiatives in the region.

65,Techno-economic analysis of solar photovoltaic system for fishery cold storage based on ownership models and regulatory boundaries in indonesia,"With IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marine resources abundance, it is appropriate for IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic growth to gear towards the fisheries sector. Fishery management in Indonesia is still not operating optimally due to a lack of fisheries management infrastructure. This study took place at the Fish Auction Place in Dadap Village, West Java, Indonesia. The actual problem is a fluctuation in fish catch due to seasonal factors that cause instability in fish prices and fishermenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incomes. Furthermore, there is no cold storage for storing fish when the fish are abundant so that the quality of the fish will decrease. However, fishery cold storage is energy-intensive equipment, and there is a lack of electricity infrastructure in that coastal area. Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are the key for rural electricity because RES prices are lower, especially on-grid solar photovoltaic (PV), than fossil fuel-based. Consequently, the application of solar PV in Indonesia is still not optimal due to limited regulations. Regulations that hinder the economic value of On-grid PV system are the excess energy compensation percentage and the inverter capacity limitation. Therefore, in this study, we have modelled six regulatory scenarios related to On-grid PV system. The scenarios are how the current 65% excess energy compensation is changed to 85% and 100% (1:1 ratio) and remove the regulation regarding inverter capacity limitation. Furthermore, the ownership model of cold storage is also considered by dividing it into two models, which are commercial-based and community-based. These ownership models have different financial instruments. The simulation gives a new result by changing regulation assumptions that On-grid PV system has a lower Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) than existing regulation because it can produce threefold more electricity to the utility grid with higher inverter capacity. Furthermore, the community-based cold storage rental price can be 16 % cheaper on average with all energy system topologies than the commercial-based ownership model. Then, by reducing the capital costs of solar modules and batteries in 2030, solar PV systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LCOE will be lower by an average of 20%. It will result in an average reduction of 10% on cold storage rental prices. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the energy system is also conducted in this study. The result is that On-grid PV system is the most secure energy source against price fluctuations. Ã‚Â© 2021 by the authors.

67,Characteristics of successful asthma programs,"Objective. We identified characteristics of interventions associated with positive asthma outcomes to understand how programs can be improved. Methods. We identified asthma interventions from the peer-reviewed literature or through a nomination process for unpublished programs. Initially, we identified 532 interventions. Of those, 223 met our eligibility criteria (e.g., focus on asthma, completed an evaluation, and demonstrated at least one asthmarelated health outcome) and provided information on program components and processes, administration, evaluation, and findings through telephone interviews, program documents, and published reports. We analyzed bivariate relationships between programmatic factors and outcomes using Chi-square statistics, Fisher's exact tests, and unconditional logistic regression. We confirmed findings for all programs by analyzing the subset with published results in peer-reviewed journals. Results. Our findings indicated that programs were more likely to report a positive impact on health outcomes if they (1) were community based, (2) engaged the participation of community-based organizations, (3) provided program components in a clinical setting, (4) provided asthma training to health-care providers, (5) collaborated with other organizations and institutions and with government agencies, (6) designed a program for a specific racial/ ethnic group, (7) tailored content or delivery based on individual health or educational needs, and (8) conducted environmental assessments and tailored interventions based on these assessments. Conclusions. Positive asthma outcomes were associated with specific program characteristics: being community centered, clinically connected, and continuously collaborative.

68,"Mangrove forests in Sri Lanka: An updated review on distribution, diversity, current state of research and future perspectives","Mangrove forests, which are well known for coastal protection and carbon sequestration, are a very productive ecosystem found in estuarine and coastal areas in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This study reviews the current status of mangrove ecology, management and conservation in Sri Lanka. In 2015, Sri Lanka became the first nation to legally protect all its mangrove forests; hence mangrove management in Sri Lanka may act as an important exemplar for other nations. Mangroves are found sporadically in the coastal area of Sri Lanka, including as a few dense mangrove forests. Mangrove vegetation provides a cost-effective ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction capability in Sri Lanka, particularly in the areas with poor living standards. Mangroves are used for timber, fishing materials, medicine and food in the country. Despite the environmental and socioeconomic importance of mangroves, several threats, including the expansion of aquaculture and agriculture, urbanization, pollution, climate change and sea level rise, exist in Sri Lanka. Many mangrove reforestation and afforestation initiatives in Sri Lanka have not succeeded, often because of the lack of sufficient monitoring of seedlings after the reforestation campaign and poor selection of planting sites without proper assessment of environmental conditions. In order to protect mangrove forests in Sri Lanka, some immediate measures need to be implemented. Proper planting of seedlings, community-based mangrove reforestation, sustainable aquaculture practices and proper legal enforcement are some of the important steps for the conservation of this highly productive ecosystem in the country.

69,"Ten years of Inuit co-management: advancing research, resilience, and capacity in Nunatsiavut through fishery governance","Community-based approaches have risen to prominence in fisheries governance as decisionÃ‚Â makers have recognized the importance of local perspectives, and Indigenous Peoples have pursued their right to self-determination. In Canada, some Indigenous Peoples have pursued a formalized approach to co-management through land claim agreements. The Torngat Joint Fisheries Board (TJFB) is one such co-management arrangement that focuses on fisheries management in Nunatsiavut, a land claim area in northern Labrador, Canada. This research examines how the TJFBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work contributes to fisheries governance in the region, and subsequently, how co-management is placed in terms of supporting greater self-determination for Indigenous peoples in resource governance. To understand the TJFBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role, this research examined 12Ã‚Â years of recorded meeting minutes from 2010 to 2021, highlighting the activities in which the TJFB engages, and how those activities have changed over time. Inductive content analysis was used to understand the activities undertaken by the TJFB, highlighting their actions as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the co-management board in practice. The analysis found that the TJFB plays important roles in research, drafting recommendations, and public education, and that their activities support greater participation from fisheries stakeholders. Land claimÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased co-management has a significant impact on how Indigenous sovereignty operates and how it will evolve into the future. The TJFBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to increase research capacity in the region, push focus towards the socio-cultural dimensions of fisheries management, and strengthen the political voice of the region represent an important move toward self-determination in NunatsiavutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commercial fisheries.

71,A Review of Factors Influencing the Seagrass-Sea Cucumber Association in Tropical Seagrass Meadows,"In the tropical ecosystem, sea cucumbers are associated with seagrass meadows in various ways, often forming a network of ecological interactions. From this myriad of interactions, the trophic relationship between the seagrasses and sea cucumbers has received recent attention with the advent of analytical techniques. However, little is understood about the exact mechanism by which seagrasses are sustaining the sea cucumber populations in the food chain, considering the high number of refractory components in seagrasses and the lack of digestive enzymes among sea cucumbers. This manuscript aims to review existing concepts in ecology concerning the association between tropical seagrasses and sea cucumbers to provide directions for research and management of this vital resource. We searched literature from electronic databases and identified key concepts concerning sea cucumber and seagrass communities based on geographic distribution, nutrient compositions, seagrass decomposition process, and trophic enrichments in the food chain. A conceptual model was then developed detailing the factors influencing the association between the seagrass meadows and sea cucumbers. Despite the limited published information on the seagrassÃ¢â‚¬â€œsea cucumber association, a synthesis of the current understanding of this topic is provided to address the declining sea cucumber populations in the tropical seagrass meadows. We suggest that the successful restoration of sea cucumber fisheries requires a thorough understanding of the seagrass decomposition process, which is vital to the diet of sea cucumbers.

72,Recommendations for the management of subsistence fisheries in South Africa,"This paper summarizes recommendations for the management of previously marginalized and neglected subsistence fisheries in South Africa. The recommendations stem from the activities and analyses of a task group appointed by Government and mandated to provide advice about management of the new fishing sector. The following focus areas were identified for attention: planning for implementation; definitions of subsistence fishers and other sectors; assessment and categorization of resources; determination of types of fishing activities; zonation; management systems; training; communication mechanisms; application and allocation procedures; compliance processes; research and monitoring; development of institutional capacity. Subsistence fishers were defined as poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet basic needs of food security. A second group of informal fishers was identified that fishes for profit but cannot be equated to large industrial fisheries, and a new sector was proposed to accommodate these artisanal ""small-scale commercial"" fishers. Resources were classified for use by these different sectors based on accessibility, fishing methods, cash value and sustainability. In all, 12 different categories of subsistence and small-scale commercial fisheries were identified, and a preliminary list of resource species suitable for different fishing sectors is presented. A multi-tiered institutional management structure is recommended, with the national agency (MCM) controlling issues of national concern, and supporting and coordinating the activities of provincial and local structures. The management agents required for effective implementation were identified and include a dedicated national Subsistence Fisheries Management Unit, provincial management agencies that have the capacity to be delegated authority, Regional Fieldworkers, an independent Advisory Group for Subsistence Fisheries Management, local co-management structures, and community monitors responsible for observing and recording fishing activities and catches: Co-management, involving both authorities and users in joint management; is advocated in preference to previous top-down approaches, because of its potential to improve communication and compliance.",NA,No,"The paper is about South Africa, not any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is focused on subsistence fisheries in South Africa, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

74,Introduction: Amazon fisheries,"Twelve years ago, a session on aquatic resources was organized during the first vÃƒÂ¡rzea conference. The articles presented in this session focused exclusively on fish resources, and analyses were based on only two study areas. The potential of community-based management for sustainable use of aquatic resources dominated the discussions. Twelve years later, the second vÃƒÂ¡rzea conference organized a similar session on aquatic resources. Some resemblances between the sessions could be noted, including familiar authors, research areas, and topics. The differences, however, are worth noting, among them the inclusion of floodplain resources other than fish. Community-based management again dominated the discussion but the second conference featured more critical analysis of its potential and limitations since after years of practical experience, several initiatives are evaluated. In general the chapters in this section show that significant progress in theory, methods, and practice was achieved in the last decade. Several issues remain to be better explored, including monitoring problems, and the availability of very limited data on co-management processes for making policy decisions. Scale also remains an issue, as do a series of land tenure issues. Ã‚Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

75,The role of taboos in the protection and recovery of sea turtles,"Despite increased efforts from government agencies, scientists, and non-government organizations over the past few decades, anthropogenic sources of sea turtle mortality continue to threaten the survivorship of sea turtle species around the globe. More recent efforts to engage local people with community-based sea turtle conservation programs have been based primarily on economic incentives and less on cultural and social traditions. But there is growing evidence that informal institutions such as, taboos can be extremely effective at promoting wildlife conservation. Ghana is a culturally diverse country where local traditions have shown to improve protection for primates, crocodiles, and many bird species. This study explores the presence of a sea turtle taboo in fishing communities to demonstrate that traditional practices make residents more receptive to sea turtle conservation and more willing to follow government regulations. Fishers in the communities that are aware of the taboo are also more willing to adjust fishing methods to better protect sea turtles. The traditional taboo and national laws appear to be working synergistically to enhance sea turtle conservation in some regions of Ghana. This paper extends the argument that sea turtle conservation strategies succeed when the cultural and social traditions of local communities are integrated with management activities.

76,Politics of marine conservation area in Indonesia: From a centralised to a decentralised system,"This paper aims to analyse the current situation resulting from the Marine Conservation Area (MCA) in Indonesia in terms of the legal framework, institutional conflicts and the response of the local people. A case study of the centralised and decentralised MCA in West Lombok is presented, and the process of establishing the MCA and its institutional performance are reviewed. The performance of centralised system is still questioned because this system marginalises the local people that leads to the rise of conflict and eventually weakens the institution of MCA. Therefore, strengthening decentralised system is necessary to increase the sense of stewardship of the local people over the resources, and to shape a new paradigm of the relationship of poor people-environment and conservation-fisheries, so marginalisation of the local people can be avoided and finally a robust institution can be created. Nevertheless, the case of Awig-awig as a type of community-based coral reef management in Gili Indah shows that decentralised system does not assure achievement of more robust institutional performance. This means that the success of decentralisation is not taken for granted, but there is prerequisite to be considered. At the community level, the prerequisite is a creation of better institutional arrangement including increasing equitability among resource users, a better representation system during process of consensus building and a well-defined property right system. Furthermore, the improvement of legal framework in national level is necessary to create more harmonious legal products related to the marine conservation with emphasis on how to recognise and enhance capacity of the local institution, which may belong to the local government or the local people, in the marine conservation. Thus, community-based management or co-management system can be officially recognised and promoted. In addition, the decentralisation of marine conservation also requires the local governments to have adequate capacity building includes the following aspects: administration skill, political savvy, adaptability and expertise skill.

77,"Environmental awareness and biodiversity conservation among resettled communal farmers in Gwayi Valley Conservation Area, Zimbabwe","This study was conducted in Gwayi Valley Conservation Area in Zimbabwe. The objective was to evaluate the level of environmental awareness raising among rural communities resettled by government in a wildlife conservation area and their behavior and actions towards biodiversity conservation. We selected three communities based on the degree of exposure to environmental awareness campaigns by various government departments and non-governmental organizations. This formed a gradient of exposure to environmental awareness campaigns, ranging from the most accessible and exposed community (Hangano), moderately exposed (Gwayi) through to the least accessible and exposed community (Karna). We used focus group discussions, key informant interviews and structured interviews with 95 respondents in the selected communities from November 2016 to April 2017. Through public awareness raising, a number of conservation groups were established including fire and hunting committees, anti-poaching teams and environmental resource monitors. While these groups were found to be either inactive or less effective in Gwayi and Karna, all were found to be very active and effective in Hangano. Similarly, community behavior and actions that caused biodiversity loss such as indiscriminate cutting of live trees, poaching, streambank cultivation, fishing in rivers with nets and use of sledges were much reduced in Hangano than in Gwayi and Karna. Frequent environmental awareness campaigns played a critical role in promoting biodiversity in Hangano. We conclude that substantial gains can be made in environmental conservation by investing more in public awareness campaigns, particularly in developing countries such as Zimbabwe where financial resources for conservation are scarce.

78,"Institutional restructuring of fisheries management system for humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus R PPELL 1835) in Anambas and Natuna, Riau Archipelago Province, Indonesia","This policy analysis paper revisits the existing traditional institutions concerned with Humphead wrasse management in Anambas and Natuna, Riau Archipelago Province. It provides an analysis and synthesis of policies that could give direction to the formation and/or strengthening of existing institutions for the benefit of this endangered fish species and all concerned parties. Local community's active involvement and participation is key to the sustainable development of fisheries resources. However, the local community's economic empowerment would be impossible to achieve without institutional strengthening. The paper recommends that community-based institutional empowerment or the ""group approach""should be considered in Anambas and Natuna's fisheries management system for Humphead wrasse. Organized fishing communities can be effective government partners in the management of open fishing areas in their jurisdictions. Fishing communities also have a vision, mission or resource management strategy specific to their own needs, values and aspirations. Defining and articulating the community's vision, mission and values are therefore crucial to the success of any community initiatives concerning fisheries revitalization programs.

79,"Questioning community based coral reef management systems: Case study of awig-awig in Gili Indah, Indonesia","Issues and complexities arising when the fisheries and marine tourism sectors have stakes in an institution governing the coral reefs ecosystem called awig-awig are discussed, awig-awig is a colloquialism meaning 'a local rule'. The community-based management system is commonly recognized as a better approach to governing resources, however, the success of awig-awig in the study area is questionable. Awig-awig fails to deal with the conflict of interest among stakeholders in coastal resource appropriation, despite the community being relatively culturally homogenous. The benefits of awig-awig are biased in favor of the tourism as opposed to fisheries, leading to the fishers' resistance of awig-awig. There are critical factors to this weakness: a crisis of legitimacy within community, socio-economic inequality among actors involved in such system, high intervention from external agencies, and the institutional conflict over conservation policy. In addition, awig-awig reduces community spirit as it is perceived as not being attached to any customary law or traditional norms.

80,Releases of cultured sub-adult Trochus niloticus generate broodstock for fishery replenishment in Vanuatu,"The over-fished topshell Trochus niloticus ('trochus') was cultured in Vanuatu and grown to sub-adult size (Ã¢Ë†Â¼40mm) in sea cages. We released 200 of these trochus at each of five reef sites managed through Customary Marine Tenure (CMT) to test the utility of this approach for restocking. The trochus were individually tagged, measured and placed into crevices behind the reef crest. Searches at the sites after 6 months yielded conservative recapture estimates of 36-47% of tagged individuals at sites. Average growth rates were >2.3mm per month, allowing the trochus to reach shell sizes of 50-60mm, known to be the onset of sexual maturity. Small, yet significant differences in growth rates between release sites (P<0.001) suggest that this restocking approach could be optimised if the ecological correlates to growth rates are identified. Under community-based management through CMT, release of sub-adult trochus can be a successful, final step in promoting hatchery-produced juveniles to maturity to allow natural restocking of different types of depleted reefs.

81,"Involvement of community in managing coastal Wetlands in South Asia: Status, issues and challenges","The development and population pressures on the coastal states of South Asia have significant impact on their coastal resources. As a large number of coastal communities are highly dependent on the coastal resources, the decline in resources affects their livelihoods. To manage the coastal resources effectively from further damage, a community-oriented mode of resource management is highly recommended, as it imparts the sense of stewardship and accountability in extraction and use of the resources. The community participation in ecosystem conservation and management has been implemented in South Asia through various enabling policies, regulatory frameworks and community practices. Conservation through involvement of people has not only yielded benefits to coastal environment and resources but also helped people to gain food security and income through tourism.

82,Cultural influences on safety and health education among Vietnamese fishermen,"Every ethnic group has its own cultural background and history that influences how it views health behaviors. By virtue of their work history, many Vietnamese have pursued the fishing industry when migrating to the United States. Even though the fishing trades are among the most dangerous jobs in the world, there has been little attention in the literature to the significant role that culture plays in the expression and experience of occupational health practices among Vietnamese shrimp fishermen. Three focus group sessions were conducted to identify factors that hinder or facilitate receptivity to available training and to guide culturally appropriate content. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling among various Vietnamese shrimp fishermen communities in Texas. Utilizing a series of open-ended questions, sessions were conducted in their native language among owners/ captains/deckhands; support infrastructure-adult family members and religious/community leaders; and industry management and insurance representatives. Translations of transcribed documents were compared with simultaneous translations to ensure thematic consistency. Conducting hands-on training among Vietnamese by experienced fishermen, specifically targeting captains, was considered key to safety culture on the vessels. Findings of the study support that training should occur in a variety of formats (hands-on), but should be periodic, current, practical, convenient, taught in the primarylanguage of the audience by an experienced individual, culminate in a certificate of completion, and target captains first. These findings illustrate the importance of considering cultural factors in the design of workplace interventions that focus on changes in safety and occupational health behaviors.

83,Climate variability and massive mortalities challenge giant clam conservation and management efforts in French Polynesia atolls,"In 2004, the first no-take area (NTA) dedicated to the conservation of giant clams Tridacna maxima was implemented in Tatakoto Atoll, French Polynesia. This NTA protected a unique area worldwide, with extraordinarily high giant clam densities (up to 337 individuals per m2 on 20-m transect). In 2012, a stock assessment survey revealed a dramatic decrease of the clam population. The reduced densities peaked at 38indm-2 and the stock in the NTA decreased from 20.1Ã‚Â±6.0million to 1.9Ã‚Â±0.55million clams (meanÃ‚Â±95% confidence interval). Losses of similar proportions were observed throughout the atoll. Remarkably, the 83% overall loss of this natural resource used daily for consumption and for exports of clam meat to Tahiti Island went unnoticed by the local population. Field clues, including the size of live juveniles attached to the inside of dead shells, pointed to a massive mortality occurring about 3years before the 2012 survey. Examinations of sea surface temperature satellite data identified a high range of temperature variations before March 2009. In agreement with past and recent events in other atolls, this anomaly is the most likely explanation of the massive loss of giant clams in Tatakoto Atoll, although the exact hydrological and biological secondary mechanisms that occurred in the lagoon remain unclear. The consequences of the massive die-off inside and outside the NTA require new long-term management strategies, by reinforcing the top-down national giant clam management arrangements and by setting flexible management objectives across a network of islands.

84,Effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas in the Philippines for Biodiversity Conservation [Efectividad de las ÃƒÂreas Marinas Protegidas en las Filipinas para la ConservaciÃƒÂ³n de Biodiversidad],"Quantifying the extent to which existing reserves meet conservation objectives and identifying gaps in coverage are vital to developing systematic protected-area networks. Despite widespread recognition of the Philippines as a global priority for marine conservation, limited work has been undertaken to evaluate the conservation effectiveness of existing marine protected areas (MPAs). Targets for MPA coverage in the Philippines have been specified in the 1998 Fisheries Code legislation, which calls for 15% of coastal municipal waters (within 15 km of the coastline) to be protected within no-take MPAs, and the Philippine Marine Sanctuary Strategy (2004), which aims to protect 10% of coral reef area in no-take MPAs by 2020. We used a newly compiled database of nearly 1000 MPAs to measure progress toward these targets. We evaluated conservation effectiveness of MPAs in two ways. First, we determined the degree to which marine bioregions and conservation priority areas are represented within existing MPAs. Second, we assessed the size and spacing patterns of reserves in terms of best-practice recommendations. We found that the current extent and distribution of MPAs does not adequately represent biodiversity. At present just 0.5% of municipal waters and 2.7-3.4% of coral reef area in the Philippines are protected in no-take MPAs. Moreover, 85% of no-take area is in just two sites; 90% of MPAs are &lt;1 km2. Nevertheless, distances between existing MPAs should ensure larval connectivity between them, providing opportunities to develop regional-scale MPA networks. Despite the considerable success of community-based approaches to MPA implementation in the Philippines, this strategy will not be sufficient to meet conservation targets, even under a best-case scenario for future MPA establishment. We recommend that implementation of community-based MPAs be supplemented by designation of additional large no-take areas specifically located to address conservation targets.

85,"Using a participatory impact assessment framework to evaluate a community-led mangrove and fisheries conservation approach in West Kalimantan, Indonesia","Community-based conservation has been identified as a solution to biodiversity loss, climate change and the reduction of rural poverty. The heterogeneity in social and economic inequalities often acts as a barrier to community engagement in resource management and further inhibits the distributional equity of social and ecological outcomes. This study presents a participatory impact assessment (PIA) framework that evaluated the outcomes of a cross-sector community-led conservation initiative. Community members involved in the programme identified activities and outcomes for the conservation cooperative (CC), ranking the influence of the former on the latter as well as their daily life through multiple focus group discussions (FGDs). Participants were asked to rank the impact of activities on outcomes and the scale of the outcome which was totalled to identify the most impactful programme activities and outcomes during the project period. Community members reported improved income, health, education and the creation of a locally led natural resource management system. Members also reported improved crab harvest rates and reduced mangrove deforestation. Environmental outcomes identified by community members through the PIA were verified through a secondary spatial analysis and mud crab independent fisheries monitoring. The results support the hypothesis that environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) need to consider a multi-dimensional view of human well-being, and that cross-sector integrated interventions may be effective at improving multiple outcomes. Future steps should focus on spatial replication of the CC programme which will provide further insights by testing for differences in outcomes between villages, how those are impacted by pre-existing social and ecological systems and comparing outcomes between control sites that did not receive interventions.

86,Developing locally managed marine areas: Lessons learnt from Kenya,"Coastal communities in Kenya are increasingly adopting Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) and by 2015, 24 had been established. Coastal communities perceive the objectives of these LMMAs are to primarily conserve fisheries and marine resources and secure alternative sources of income. In this study we examined if there are generic approaches in how these LMMAs were established, that can be used for developing national guidelines as well as have application to other locations in the western Indian Ocean region. The study involved a literature review of all documents available on the LMMAs and key informant interviews. We found LMMAs in Kenya go through five phases to become fully established and operational: i) Conceptualisation, ii) Inception, iii) Implementation, iv) Monitoring and management; and v) Ongoing Adaptive Management. We defined each stage by the activities that are taking place which determine how far a LMMA has reached in its development. The final phase is when a LMMA exists sustainably in a continuous learning process. Out of 19 LMMAs assessed, four had reached the fifth stage of Ã¢â‚¬ËœOngoing Adaptive ManagementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ though not all elements of this stage were fully operational. The Kenyan model differs from the widely known Pacific model of four phases due to an additional initial Ã¢â‚¬ËœConceptualisationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ phase. Our results illustrate the need for full acceptance of the LMMA concept by stakeholders before progressing to the Ã¢â‚¬ËœInception phase.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ When this step was missed many LMMAs stalled due to unaddressed training needs, incomplete involvement of stakeholders and lack of financial resources, management and operational structures. These five phases provide a useful guide for communities and other stakeholders to follow when developing LMMAs, or for those that are established and need guidance on their operations. Common factors that we found associated with the development of LMMAs were informed and committed community members, past training in community based marine resource management, a supportive legal framework, external funding and opportunities for sharing LMMA information. The occurrence of an exchange visit to an existing LMMA was invariably the trigger for a community to establish their own LMMA. Weaknesses were seen in poor enforcement on the water and inadequate ongoing education and training. Further there was very little understanding of the costs of establishing and running a LMMA, therefore long term financial sustainability was problematic. Thus, although the rapid increase in the number of LMMAs in Kenya is a conservation success, their effectiveness will be thwarted if enforcement and financial management are not addressed.

87,"Comparison of strategies to increase HIV testing among African-American gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in Washington, DC","This paper presents results from a study conducted to compare the relative effectiveness of three strategies - alternate venue testing (AVT), the social network strategy (SNS), and partner counseling and referral services (PCRS; standard care) - for reaching and motivating previously undiagnosed, African-American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) to be tested for HIV. Data were collected between June 2008 and February 2010 at a gay-identified, community-based organization (CBO) serving AA MSM in Washington, DC. Men were eligible to participate if they were 18-64 years old, self-identified as black or African-American, were biologically male, and self-reported oral or anal sex with a man in the past six months. Fisher's exact test of independence was used to assess differences in demographics, testing history, HIV status and sexual behaviors across the three strategies. The final sample included 470 men who met all eligibility requirements. There were no statistically significant differences in HIV positivity rates across the three strategies. However, relative to standard care, the SNS, and (to a lesser degree) the AVT strategies were more successful in recruiting men that had never been tested. Additionally, the results indicate that each strategy recruited different subgroups of men. Specifically, heterosexually identified men and men who reported engaging in unprotected sex were most likely to be recruited via SNS.

88,The challenges of local governance: Gear-based fragmentation in the Dominican fishery of Buen Hombre,"The Dominican fishing community of Buen Hombre is struggling to reconcile its fishing activities with the state of the coral reef ecosystem on which it depends. The ecosystem is showing signs of deterioration, and this seems to be resulting in large part because of the fishing activities of the Buen Hombre fishermen. The institutional arrangements of the fishermen themselves, and of relevant external organizations, have not kept pace with important technological and demographic changes that have affected the community. This paper presents the results of an analysis that unpacks these processes via a statistical analysis of fishermen behavior and a social network analysis of the "" cofishing"" network that these fishermen constitute. The statistical analysis shows that gear choice is very important in explaining the amount of fish caught, both as a direct factor and as a mediator of other factors such as membership in the local fishermen's association. The social network analysis complements this result by demonstrating that gear choice also serves to segment the fishermen into separate groups, with few direct linkages between them. The resulting gear-based fragmentation of the community is seen to have negative implications for the ability of the fishermen to act collectively to conserve their fishery. The paper concludes with some thoughts and suggestions for how the community might move forward, including expanding the membership of the fishermen's association and strengthening ties between fishing groups as well as ties between the community and relevant governmental agencies.

89,"Whitefish fisheries in mountainous southeastern Norway: Abundant resources, but scarce fisherman","Commercial utilization of inland fish resources can constitute an important addition to other economic activities in rural communities. Based on a case study of commercial whitefish fishery in Lake Femund, a mountain lake in southeastern Norway, this article outlines experience gained and indicates some of the general problems related to this type of economic activity. They concern aspects such as resource biology, product development and marketing, economic management, and staff recruitment. An initial hypothesis of the study was that commercial fishery would have a significant impact on the whitefish stock, causing fluctuations in yield and consequent variations in the economy of the fishery. Therefore, the study included an analysis of marketing possibilities for whitefish products, as well as of the social and socioeconomic conditions sustaining whitefish fishery in the local community. Nearly 20 years of data show that commercial fishery in Lake Femund, with a yield of up to 1 kg per ha, has a low to moderate exploitation rate. Thus, fishery itself does not generate fluctuations in the fish population that would influence yields. The major restrictions on the enterprise are related to other aspects, such as problems of economic and technical management of this specialized small-scale industry, difficulties in the recruitment of fishermen to a short-season fishery in a time when the employment pattern in the community is changing from seasonal activities in agriculture to full-time employment in manufacturing and services, and the challenge of developing and marketing competitive products for a niche market.",NA,No,The paper's case study is from a location not listed in the SC.," No; The paper is based on a case study from southeastern Norway, not any of the listed locations.

90,Estimating willingness to pay with the stochastic payment card design: Further evidence from rural Cameroon,"This study reports new empirical findings of the field test of the stochastic payment card (SPC) design recently proposed by Wang (Contingent valuation of environmental resources: A stochastic perspective, 1997a; Journal of Environmental Economics & Management 32:219-232, 1997b). The purpose is to see how well this new contingent valuation method (CVM) elicitation format works in different cultural contexts, and what lessons can be drawn in general regarding its usefulness in environmental valuation. The survey is designed to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) values for an intended community-based environmental project in rural Cameroon (i.e., the control of malaria using larvivorous eating fish species). In order to estimate the bid function, Heckman's 2-step method is used to detect, and if possible, correct for sample selection bias, an issue overlooked by the 2-step modeling approach proposed by Wang (1997a). The results suggest generally that in the presence of sample selection bias, Heckman's 2-step estimates are more efficient and reliable for the public project in question than Wang's proposed 2-stage modeling approach.

91,Artisanal Fisher Association LeadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Estimates of Poaching in Their Exclusive Access Management Areas,"In marine environments, poaching can become a key threat to marine ecosystem conservation. Poaching can occur in marine protected areas and/or in fishery management areas. Unfortunately, understanding the magnitude and characteristics of poaching under community based and co-management governance schemes in coastal and marine environments, has not received the attention it deserves. In Chile, a system of Territorial Users Rights for Fisheries (TURF) has been recognized as one of the largest experiences of small-scale fisheries co-management at a global scale. Currently, poaching is one of the main threats to the TURF system in Chile. In this article, we assessed poaching of a highly valuable benthic resource (Concholepas concholepas) from TURF management areas. We estimated artisanal fisher association leadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceptions of poaching within their TURFs and explore determinants of poaching for Concholepas concholepas. Poaching of Concholepas concholepas showed differences along the studied sites. As expected, the greater abundance of Concholepas concholepas in the management areas generates an increased incentive to poach. Areas that make the greatest investment in surveillance are those most affected by poaching. However, our study cannot determine the effectiveness of current levels of surveillance on illegal extraction. Results show older areas tend to reduce the levels of illegal extraction, which could indicate a greater capacity and experience to control poaching. Supporting fisher associations in enforcing TURFs and following up on sanctions against perpetrators are conditioning factors, highlighted by fisher leaders, for TURF sustainability. The approach used in this study provides insights to prioritize geographies and opportunities to address poaching in small-scale co-managed fisheries.

92,Livelihoods and fisheries governance in a contemporary Pacific Island setting,"Inshore marine resources play an important role in the livelihoods of Pacific Island coastal communities. However, such reliance can be detrimental to inshore marine ecosystems. Understanding the livelihoods of coastal communities is important for devising relevant and effective fisheries management strategies. Semi-structured household interviews were conducted with householders in Langalanga Lagoon, Solomon Islands, to understand household livelihoods and resource governance in fishing-dependent communities. Households were engaged in a diverse range of livelihoods. Fishing, shell money production and gardening were the most important livelihoods. Proximity to an urban centre influenced how households accessed some livelihoods. Perceptions of management rules varied and different reasons were cited for why rules were broken, the most common reason being to meet livelihood needs. Current models of inshore small-scale fisheries management that are based on the notion of community-based resource management may not work in locations where customary management systems are weak and livelihoods are heavily reliant on marine resources. An important step for fisheries management in such locations should include elucidating community priorities through participatory development planning, taking into consideration livelihoods as well as governance and development aspirations.

93,Translating systems thinking into practice for community action on childhood obesity,"We report on the first 18Ã‚Â months of two communities' efforts using methods inspired by community-based participatory system dynamics for the development, implementation, and evaluation of whole of community efforts to improve the health of children. We apply Foster-Fishman's theoretical framework for characterizing systems change to describe the initiatives. Bounding the system began with defining leaders more broadly than standard health interventions to be those who had the ability to change environments to improve health, including food retailers, government, and business, and using high-quality childhood monitoring data to define the problem. Widespread access to junk food, barriers to physical activity, and efforts to promote health predominantly through programmatic approaches were identified as potential root causes. System interactions existed in the form of relationships between stakeholder groups and organizations. The approach described built new relationships and strengthened existing relationships. Willingness in taking risks, changing existing practice, and redesigning health promotion work to have a community development focus, were levers for change. This approach has resulted in hundreds of community-led actions focused on changing norms and environments. Insights from this approach may be useful to support other communities in translating systems theory into systems practice.

94,The Gunnison Basin sage-grouse strategic committee: A Colorado county's fight for conservation self-determination,"Since 1995, sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.) conservation planning in the western United States has largely been based upon local working groups (LWGs) comprised of federal, state, and local governments; environmental groups; landowners; and interested citizens. In this article, we review the history and process of LWGs in western Colorado that were formed to develop Gunnison sage-grouse (C. minimus) conservation plans. The LWGs were generally convened by Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1 government agency, operate on the general principle of consensus, and had little or no administrative or fi nancial support. The LWGs were generally comprised of fi eld biologists, rancher/landowners, members of local environmental groups, and occasionally representatives from local governments. The plans they generated were based upon consensus; therefore, diffi cult issues were often bypassed to keep the plan development process moving. The early successes of these LWGs resulted in sage-grouse conservation plans such as the Gunnison Sage-grouse Conservation Plan, which provided sage-grouse conservation guidance for the Gunnison Basin in southcentral Colorado. However, there were problems such as an undefi ned membership, lack of administrative support, and achieving consensus. The Gunnison County Board of County Commissioners (BoCC) created an entirely new approach to the LWG concept. The Gunnison Basin Sage-grouse Strategic Committee (GBSGSC) was created, with appointed (by the BoCC) representatives from the federal land management agencies, the state wildlife agency, the neighboring county, the ranching community, the environmental community, the development community, the recreation community, and the public at large. Formal operating guidelines were adopted by the BoCC. Specifi c membership criteria were identifi ed, and administrative staff from Gunnison County was assigned. Importantly, the BoCC determined that the committee would operate under majority rule. The GBSGSC has been meeting monthly since 2005.

95,Uncommon among the commons? Disentangling the sustainability of the Peruvian anchovy fishery,"The term ""commons"" refers to collectively exploited resources and their systems of usage; a synonymous term is common pool resources. Fisheries are typical common pool resources and also one of the most conspicuous examples of unsustainable use of natural resources. We examine one of the few globally important fisheries that is held to be sustainable, the Peruvian anchovy fishery, and considers the extent to which the institutional characteristics of the fishery conform to design principles that are considered prerequisites for long-term, successful, community-based common pool resources. Results showed that greater conformity to the principles was found in the sustainable phase of the fishery, compared to its unsustainable phase. For this case study, the conditions that supported the transition towards sustainability were: clearly defined resource boundaries, monitoring of rule enforcement, and conflict resolution mechanisms among users and management authorities. On the other hand, clearly defined user boundaries, collective choice arrangements, and nested enterprises were not required to achieve sustainability. The study concludes that the design principles are a valuable tool for analysis and understanding of large-scale common pool resource systems. At the same time it suggests that the application of the principles to a wider range of systems can generate new insights into what is required for successful management of common pool resources.

96,"Qualitative participatory mapping of seal and walrus harvest and habitat areas: Documenting indigenous knowledge, preserving local values, and discouraging map misuse","In the Bering Strait region of Alaska decreasing sea ice and increasing development are driving environmental and policy changes that significantly impact federally recognized tribes, which depend on marine resources for cultural, economic, and nutritional reasons. Kawerak, Inc., an Alaska Native non-profit tribal consortium, conducted participatory ice seal and walrus harvest and habitat mapping in collaboration with nine of the region's federally recognized tribes. Participants were concerned that maps could misrepresent marine mammal mobility, limit future harvest area flexibility, increase outside regulation of harvest activities, generate conflict between communities, and attract commercial activity. This paper addresses these concerns through a technique called qualitative participatory mapping, which preserves local voices and priorities. This technique helped communicate and convey respect for traditional knowledge while lowering the probability of map misuse or misinterpretation.

98,"Defining fishers in the South African context: Subsistence, artisanal and small-scale commercial sectors","Evolution of a new policy for the management of marine fisheries in South Africa led to the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA). Among other innovations, this requires that management strategies be developed for subsistence fisheries. As a prerequisite, definitions and criteria are needed to identify and distinguish them. To achieve this, the Chief Director of Marine & Coastal Management (MCM), the authority responsible for managing marine fisheries, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to make recommendations about definitions and modes of management. The process involved successive surveys and consultations with fishing communities, communication with MCM, and a national workshop of all participants. This led to consensus about the following definition: Subsistence fishers are poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet the basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the kinds of resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet the basic needs of food security. This definition builds on the facts that existing subsistence fisheries are usually: (1) local operations; (2) customary, traditional or cultural; (3) undertaken for personal or family use; (4) primarily for nutritional needs (though excess resources may be sold to ensure food security); (5) based on minimal technology; and (6) undertaken by people with low cash incomes. They are specifically non-commercial and non-recreational. The definition was designed to allow protection of the rights of these people and sustainability of the resources. While developing this definition, it became obvious that the definition of ""commercial fishing"" in the MLRA is also inadequate, and a new definition was developed. Commercial fisheries span a wide spectrum, and the SFTG defined ""small-scale commercial fishers"" as a distinct component that has not received adequate attention, and for whom specific management plans need to be developed. They are distinguished by living on or close to the coast, having a history of involvement with fishing, being personally involved in hands-on day-to-day running of their enterprises, operating with limited amounts of capital investment and low levels of technology, and employing small numbers of people.",NA,No,"The paper is specifically about marine fisheries in South Africa, not any of the countries listed in the SC."," No; The paper is focused on the South African context, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

In response, place-based strategies involve communities and resource users in management have proliferated. Here, we present a transferable community-based approach to assess the social and ecological factors affecting resource sustainability and food security in a small-scale, coral reef fishery. Our results show that this small-scale fishery provides large-scale benefits to communities, including 7,353 Ã‚Â± 1547 kg yr-1 (mean Ã‚Â± SE) of seafood per year, equating to >30,000 meals with an economic value of $78,432. The vast majority of the catch is used for subsistence, contributing to community food security: 58% is kept, 33.5% is given away, and 8.5% is sold. Our spatial analysis assesses the geographic distribution of community beneficiaries from the fishery (the ""food shed"" for the fishery), and we document that 20% of seafood procured from the fishery is used for sociocultural events that are important for social cohesion. This approach provides a method for assessing social, economic, and cultural values provided by small-scale food systems, as well as important contributions to food security, with significant implications for conservation and management.

100,Changing understandings of local knowledge in island environments,"Island ecosystems have rich marine biodiversity and high levels of terrestrial endemism, but are potentially the most vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic stressors. To effectively manage environments, scholars and conservation practitioners have increasingly turned their attention to local islander knowledge (LK) and practices. To date, much of the literature treats LK definitionally rather than examining its theoretical underpinnings. This review focuses explicitly on the concept of LK and it describes three discernible phases of research marked by conceptual shifts. Over the 20th century, LK underwent a dramatic reversal from something understood as inferior and deficient to something that is valuable and empirically sound. This shift ushered in widespread acceptance of local islander knowledge as a unique, rich corpus of information that could be tapped by Western science to enhance community-based resource management. Over the last several decades, a third phase of LK research has emerged in which a more dynamic framing has developed, emphasizing LK's hybrid and adaptive dimensions, as well as its constitutive entanglements with other social-ecological processes. This has expanded the scope of inquiry into the strategies islanders employ as they adapt to changing social and environmental milieus, and as they attempt to co-produce knowledge with scientists and conservation practitioners.

102,"Combining human preference and biodiversity priorities for marine protected area site selection in Sabah, Malaysia","High human reliance on marine resources in developing countries is a challenge for implementing marine protected areas, which usually seek to limit or restrict fishing in selected areas. Fishers' spatial preferences should be considered during the site selection process, but biodiversity considerations are generally the primary focus. The Protected Area Suitability Index (PASI) is a fuzzy logic spatial planning tool that combines human preferences and conservation criteria to assess the suitability of marine sites for being protected from fishing and other extractive use. We apply the PASI in zoning a marine sanctuary in Sabah, Malaysia, with the objectives of (i) assessing the PASI's ability to capture fishers' spatial preferences; and (ii) comparing the nuances of community based and fuzzy logic approaches in spatial planning. There was overlap in sites chosen for protection by both approaches, and multi-dimensional scaling results suggest that the PASI captures fishers' preferences. Community consultations enable direct integration of local knowledge to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, but can be time consuming and expensive.

The system dynamic model can support finding an optimal policy in managing the Local Marine Conservation Area of Pulo Pasi Gusung (LMCA-PPG), South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The objective of the study was to develop a system dynamic model, as a decision support system, to manage the coral reef ecosystem at LMCA-PPG. There are several scenarios of decision making that can be simulated to assess what impacts will occur. System dynamic (SD) modeling can be used to understand the behavior of the complex problems of a particular system. The community-based system development approach is used to construct a conceptual model by involving all interested parties. Surveillance has the highest impact on live coral cover, the biomass of herbivore fish and the net income of fishermen. Live coral cover is affected by the alteration of surveillance, because it increases the occurrence of destructive fishing. It is also affected by the availability of alternative livelihoods and by the status of a restricted zone of LMCA-PPG. There is no alternative livelihood for fishermen, highly affecting their income. Maintaining the fishermen income and livelihood will also maintain the coral reef ecosystem. The recommendations for managing the LMCA-PPG are: surveillance carried out for 20 days a month and 6 hours every day; availability of alternative livelihood for up to 45% of the fishermen population; the extension of the core zone and utilization zone up to 40% of the coral reef area, to 230 hectares.

In this context, drinking water sources are severely affected, including adverse effects on agriculture, health, fisheries and the ecosystem. This research investigates i) selected water quality parameters ii) local people's perception on drinking water scarcity iii) how local people's cope with safe drinking water scarcity. This research was conducted using local water samples, questionnaire survey of 200 households and 4 focus group discussions (FDGs) in Shyamnagar and Tala sub-district of Satkhira district. The study of the water quality parameters exposed the extreme conditions of the drinking water sources in the area. The average values of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC) and Chloride concentration (ClÃ¢Ë†â€™) were found respectively 4044.12 mg/L, 7186.7 ÃŽÂ¼S/cm, and 3143.6 mg/L in Shyamnagar and 2313.60 mg/L, 4390.3 ÃŽÂ¼S/cm, and 1402.1 mg/L in Tala. The result of community perception reveals that local people are aware of the safe water scarcity and nearly all of them perceive that salinity is the main reason behind it. Even though there are a number of socioeconomic factors, communities have their own adaptation technologies to cope with the problem. The study concludes with the development of a community based model defining the key responsibilities of the stakeholders, including local and central government, NGOs and community people to work in a well-coordinated manner which will be effective for reducing the scarcity of the safe drinking water.

Results suggest that all stakeholder groups interviewed were positive about the potential for CBMA to support sustainable aquaculture growth in the province; however, key questions around operationalizing CBMA remain. The aquaculture industry is on a continual path for growth worldwide and, therefore, it becomes increasingly important to proactively examine strategies such as CBMA that can help to facilitate EAA in a way that genuinely puts people at the centre of aquaculture development and governance.

106,"Effects of small, Fijian community-based marine protected areas on exploited reef fishes","No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are commonly applied in community-based management schemes to sustain and enhance coral-reef fisheries. However, many MPAs in Fiji and the South Pacific are relatively small (Ã¢â€°Â¤1 km 2), and few data exist regarding the effects of these MPAs on populations of exploited species. We used hook-and-line fishing surveys to assess whether 4 relatively small (&lt;1 km 2) community-based MPAs in Fiji (3 current, 1 former) were providing any commonly sought benefits to exploited reef-fish stocks. All of the MPAs had maintained no-take status for over 4 yr, although the former MPA was opened to fishing 4 mo before this study. The current MPAs exhibited significantly greater catch and biomass per unit effort, individual fish biomass, and/or percentage of reproductive-size fish than paired, adjacent fished areas, while this was not the case with the former MPA. Sites with intact MPAs also exhibited greater catch diversity than the former MPA site. Additionally, tag and recapture data from the 17 recaptured of 2650 tagged fish suggest site fidelity of these fishes, although fishes initially captured in the MPA at all 4 sites were later caught in fished areas, indicating that there is movement of fishes from the MPAs to fished areas. While the combination of these findings supports the utility of even relatively small MPAs as effective tools for the conservation of certain target species, it also suggests that MPA benefits may be quickly depleted and that even closures of extended duration may be insufficient for long-term fisheries management if the MPAs are not maintained.

107,Moving to sustainability by learning from successful fisheries,"There are two diverging views of the status and future of the world's fisheries. One group represented largely by academic marine ecologists sees almost universal failure of fisheries management and calls for the use of marine-protected areas as the central tool of a new approach to rebuilding the marine ecosystems of the world. The scientists working in fisheries agencies and many academic scientists see a more complex picture, with many failed fisheries but also numerous successes. This group argues that we need to apply the lessons from the successful fisheries to stop the decline and rebuild those fisheries threatened by excess fishing. These lessons are stopping the competitive race to fish by appropriate incentives for fishing fleets and good governance. The major tool of resetting incentives is granting various forms of dedicated access, including community-based fishing rights, allocation to cooperatives, and individual fishing quotas. Many of the failed fisheries of the world occur in jurisdictions where central governments are not functional, and local control of fisheries is an essential part of the solution.

In 1988, Uganda's government of the National Resistance Movement created the Ministry of Women in Development. The period 1988-1990 was one of consultations, needs assessment, planning, and recruiting staff for the Ministry. From 1990 to 1993, measurable results have been achieved. The Ministry's gender concerns pertained to the sector policies of the Ministries of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Education, Health, Water, Energy, Minerals, and Environment Protection. Under the Umbrella Project for Women in Development, gender sensitization has been achieved with policy makers in ministries, at district level, and in the media. Gender issues have also been incorporated in the National Political School Curriculum. The Ministry has also trained a corps of 73 women trainers from 38 districts. The Ministry, with funding from DANIDA, collected women's views on the constitution through meetings and seminars in all the districts in the country. Recommendations were submitted in a consolidated report to the Constitution Commission. A pilot para-legal scheme is successfully being implemented in Kamuli district. A community-based pool of legal advisors has been developed. Legal matters that affect both women and men are undertaken at the community level. The economic emancipation of women is a crucial part of the Ministry's mandate. In conjunction with NGOs, pilot credit programs are being run in Mukono, Jinja, Mbale, and Kapchorwa districts.

109,Livelihood Development in Coastal Chars in the Meghna Estuary: The Danida Experience,"Dynamic hydro-geomorphology in the Meghna Delta has resulted in southward movement of the Noakhali district coastline, creating successive chars, adding 1800 km2 of new land. These chars offered new opportunities for livelihood of poor people, many of whom have lost their former lands to riverbank erosion. The char stabilization and development programs were designed to adapt to the specific environment and the needs of resource-poor households in the chars. This chapter focuses on the experience of successive Danida-funded projects in fisheries and livestock in livelihood development of poor households in the Noakhali coastal chars. Particular features highlighted are: the inclusion of poor households in value chains, emphasis on low-input culture systems; the Farmer Field School approach; the importance of community-based organizations and links to local agribusiness for input and market access. Lessons learned from the experience are underscored, the need for harmonization of activities between the Danida and other projects to ensure sustainability is stressed, and the approach is compared to other recent projects in the Delta.

110,"Water, ice, and climate change in northwest Greenland","Along the coastal areas of northwest Greenland, sea ice is crucial to people's livelihoods. People in the region have long depended on hunting marine mam-mals such as seals; walrus; narwhal, beluga, fin, and minke whales; and polar bears, as well as fishing for fjord cod, Greenland halibut, salmon, and Arctic char. Terrestrial animals such as reindeer and Arctic foxes have also been of some importance, as have musk ox in some areas. However, the effects of a changing climate on the marine environment are stark, immediate, and tangi-ble. Ice is melting, and coastal waters are warming. Sea ice, glaciers, coastlines, and seas have become sites and objects for new forms of environmental governance shaped by ideas of unique and fragile ecosystems under threat at a moment of planetary crisis. Conservation organizations frame the Arctic as a zone of climate change crisis and have launched campaignsÃ¢â‚¬â€underpinned by narratives of ruinationÃ¢â‚¬â€to protect what are termed last areas of ice. However, Inuit organizations are also working to ensure that environmental governance and conservation policymaking do not exclude local communities in the region and are campaigning for protected marine areas in which wildlife management systems and community-based monitoring take note of indigenous rights and incorporate indigenous knowledge.

111,"Role of extension services with special reference to livelihood projects for supporting a community-based marine protected area in northern Luzon, Philippines","Community-based management of marine protected areas (MPAs) is widely carried out in the Philippines as a coastal resource management initiative. However, the restrictions to areas used for this conservation programme have caused loss of job opportunities to villagers who mainly depend on coastal resources for a living. As an alternative, extension services with livelihood projects (e.g. aquaculture and hog raising) have been provided to the villagers. For investigating the role of extension services specifically as a support policy to the participation of villagers in MPA management, a household survey in the Casitan village in Cagayan Province, Philippines was carried out in March 2015 through one-on-one interviews facilitated by trained enumerators. A total of 100 respondents were selected by random sampling from the List of Registered Household Heads. Key informantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ interviews were also conducted to harness the information gathered. The study revealed that support policies such as extension services with livelihood projects increase the tendency of villagers to participate in MPA management activities.

The fishery has recently been certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council provided that further stock assessment is carried out. A total of 379 lobsters were tagged in an unfished area offshore from the BahÃƒÂ­a del EspÃƒÂ­ritu Santo fishing grounds to assess whether lobsters remained within these areas and were thus fully protected. The lobsters recaptured in the shallow area (5.3%) were sufficient to develop a multistate mark recapture model, which takes into account fishing and natural mortality, tag reporting rate and tag loss. This estimated that between 15 and 20% of all adult lobsters dwelling in the unfished area moved into the fishery and were subjected to exploitation. This study suggests that the offshore unfished area provides protection to the majority of the stock in this area while adding to and maintaining fishing yields within the inshore commercial fishery.

113,Ecosystem services and community based coral reef management institutions in post blast-fishing Indonesia,"Depending upon the institutional framework, coral reef ecosystems and local economic development can be synergistic. When managed properly through local institutions, coral reef systems can deliver ecosystem services that create livelihoods and increase local prosperity in dependent communities. This study compares two community-based reef management institutions. One is located in a community with a reef struggling to recover from destructive fishing, the other in a community that has experienced a remarkable recovery. Using mixed methods, long-form interviews, and surveys of reef tourism stakeholders, this uses institutional characteristics to predict reef quality. Certain institutional components hypothesized to predict reef quality did not, these include universal membership requirements for reef stakeholders, stakeholder familiarity with leadership and hierarchies, and transparent decision-making and implementation of management policy. This means that one size fits all prescriptions for local reef management institutions should be viewed with caution. Instead, the success of management institutions may depend upon both the path toward economic development, access to technology that facilitates coral recovery, and communication of conservation strategies to tourist visitors.

Overall, the CBCRM programs in the Philippines were perceived to have a significant positive impact. However, the performance of each of the indicators was mixed. Although the CBCRM programs were perceived to be effective in empowering the local fishing communities, their perceived impact on improving the state of the local fisheries resources remained limited.

115,Investing in agricultural water management to benefit smallholder farmers in Ethiopia: AgWater Solutions Project country synthesis report,"This Working Paper summarizes research conducted as part of the AgWater Solutions Project in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2012. Rainfed agriculture and subsistence farming are the main features of agriculture. The midlands and highlands are dominated by mixed farming systems where livestock and crop production are equally important and highly integrated. In the lowlands, pastoral systems dominate. Single cropping is the norm but double-cropping is practiced along rivers in some parts of the country. Over half of Ethiopia's 64 million rural people live in poverty. Less than 10% of the 3.7 to 4.3 million hectares (Mha) of irrigable land is currently irrigated. The potential irrigable land in Ethiopia is between 3.7 and 4.3 Mha with the actual irrigated area estimated at just 7 to 10%. Researchers from the AgWater Solutions Project conducted a situation analysis in 2009, which identified a range of options deemed to be technically feasible, affordable and practical for smallholder farmers: water-lifting technologies, groundwater for agriculture and manual well drilling, community-based watershed management, on-farm water storage, small reservoirs and rainwater harvesting. The main findings of the project indicate that: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Water-lifting technologies could benefit between 1 and 2 million farm households. The main barriers to its adoption are weak supply chains, lack of extension services and access to credit. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In the coming five years, 8,000 hectares (ha) will be developed as a pilot study using groundwater. Groundwater and manual well drilling could be greatly expanded with investments in hydrogeological maps and groundwater data; and financing for private sector drilling and building a pool of skilled labor for the drilling industry. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Watershed size and hydrogeology are the key physical factors in community watershed management. Macro-watersheds performed better on all indicators than smaller watersheds. Land and crop productivity and area for cultivation increased over the years as a result of land rehabilitation, water availability for supplementary or full-scale irrigation, and new agronomic practices. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Farmers could gain considerable benefit from on-farm ponds, including higher yields and greater incomes. The government is already promoting on-farm ponds, but this is usually to store rainfall in dry areas to supplement rainfed crops. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Small reservoirs support soil and water conservation, drought proofing and small-scale community irrigation. A well-designed reservoir can sustain multiple uses, including livestock, fisheries, domestic needs and small businesses.

116,Relative influence of environmental factors and fishing on coral reef fish assemblages,"Understanding whether assemblages of species respond more strongly to bottom-up (availability of trophic resources or habitats) or top-down (predation pressure) processes is important for effective management of resources and ecosystems. We determined the relative influence of environmental factors and predation by humans in shaping the density, biomass, and species richness of 4 medium-bodied (10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ40 cm total length [TL]) coral reef fish groups targeted by fishers (mesopredators, planktivores, grazer and detritivores, and scrapers) and the density of 2 groups not targeted by fishers (invertivores, small fish Ã¢â€°Â¤10 cm TL) in the central Philippines. Boosted regression trees were used to model the response of each fish group to 21 predictor variables: 13 habitat variables, 5 island variables, and 3 fishing variables (no-take marine reserve [NTMR] presence or absence, NTMR size, and NTMR age). Targeted and nontargeted fish groups responded most strongly to habitat variables, then island variables. Fishing (NTMR) variables generally had less influence on fish groups. Of the habitat variables, live hard coral cover, structural complexity or habitat complexity index, and depth had the greatest effects on density, biomass, and species richness of targeted fish groups and on the density of nontargeted fishes. Of the island variables, proximity to the nearest river and island elevation had the most influence on fish groups. The NTMRs affected only fishes targeted by fishers; NTMR size positively correlated with density, biomass, and species richness of targeted fishes, particularly mesopredatory, and grazing and detritivorous fishes. Importantly, NTMRs as small as 15 ha positively affected medium-bodied fishes. This finding provides reassurance for regions that have invested in small-scale community-managed NTMRs. However, management strategies that integrate sound coastal land-use practices to conserve adjacent reef fish habitat, strategic NTMR placement, and establishment of larger NTMRs will be crucial for maintaining biodiversity and fisheries.

117,Aboriginal freshwater fisheries as resilient social-ecological systems,"Aboriginal fisheries are distinct from commercial and recreational fisheries in their practice, management and governance, which reflect belief systems and cultural traditions specific to indigenous ways of life. Aboriginal fisheries constitute social-ecological systems governed by environmental ethics and reciprocity relations with local community and ecosystem members. The traditional ecological knowledge, fishing practices and resource-sharing protocols of indigenous fishers reflect cultural traditions, technologies and norms embedded in community-based management. The ethical principles of reciprocity, respect, and interconnectedness and the ensuing sense of place that distinguish many indigenous cultures supported cooperation within fisheries management and governance that sustained local resources and communities. An examination of aboriginal freshwater fisheries must thus consider not only the local ecology and fish population dynamics, but also the local culture and history of the indigenous peoples. Here, I survey the state of indigenous freshwater fisheries, both their ecology and governance, through case studies in New Zealand, Cambodia, Norway, Canada and the United States, before drawing some general conclusions.

118,Social capital as a key determinant of perceived benefits of community-based marine protected areas,"Globally, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been relatively unsuccessful in meeting biodiversity objectives. To be effective, they require some alteration of people's use and access to marine resources, which they will resist if they do not perceive associated benefits. StakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ support is crucial to ecological success of MPAs, and their support is likely to depend on their capacity to adapt to and benefit from MPAs. We examined the influence of social adaptive capacity (SAC) on perceived benefits of MPAs in Siquijor, Philippines, in the Coral Triangle. This region has substantial biodiversity and a population of over 120 million people, many of them dependent on marine resources for food and income. The region has many MPAs, most of which are managed under decentralized governance systems. We collected survey data from 540 households in 19 villages with associated MPAs. We evaluated the influence of multiple SAC variables (e.g., occupational multiplicity and social capital) on perceived benefits with decision trees (CHAID) and qualitatively analyzed this relationship with respect to types and recipients of benefits. Our models revealed the key role of social capital, particularly trust in leadership, in influencing perceptions of benefits (Ãâ€¡2 = 14.762, p = 0.000). A path analysis revealed that perceptions of distributional equity were a key mechanism through which social capital affected perceived MPA benefits (root mean-square error of approximation = 0.050). Building social capital and equity within communities could lead to more effective management of MPAs and thus to expenditure of fewer resources relative to, for example, regulation enforcement.

119,"KÃ…Âkua aku, KÃ…Âkua mai: An Indigenous Consensus-driven and Place-based Approach to Community Led Dryland Restoration and Stewardship","The well-documented and forced migration of Indigenous Peoples from ancestral lands has fragmented connections to, and understandings of place. Yet Indigenous Peoples are reconceptualizing and revitalizing these connections including by leading forest landscape restoration efforts. Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) supports the design and practice of ecological restoration across rural to urban gradients Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including both ancestral lands and contemporary places, with thought leaders advocating for biocultural approaches to address biodiversity loss, land occupation, and the colonial legacies of social and economic marginalization of Indigenous Peoples. To date, there are few examples in HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi, where in 1893 the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom disenfranchised most Indigenous People of land, freshwater, and coastal resources. Here we describe the PuÃ¢â‚¬ËœuwaÃ¢â‚¬ËœawaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœa Community-Based Subsistence Forest Area (P-CBSFA), that was formed in 2017 to steward 34-ha of land within the PuÃ¢â‚¬ËœuwaÃ¢â‚¬ËœawaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœa State Forest Reserve, North Kona, HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi Island and is led by multi-generational lineal descendants of PuÃ¢â‚¬ËœuwaÃ¢â‚¬ËœawaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœa. We focus on how this stewardship initiative has relied on holistic acknowledgement in the engagement of historical context, a Native Hawaiian conceptualization of the restoration process, and a collaborative and consensus-based restoration practice that includes non-profit organizations and state and federal agencies. This initiative, the first community-based and subsistence-focused forest restoration project on State of HawaiÃŠÂ»i administered lands, is using a biocultural framework to transform 34-ha of non-native and fire-prone grasses into a native species dominated dryland subsistence forest. To do this, the P-CBSFA relies on a relationship ethic to: (i) build trust among partners; (ii) articulate an exportable vision of ILK-based restoration; (iii) walk in awareness of historical and contemporary injustices; (iv) enhance cultural values of the landscape; (v) establish and rely on formal, empathy focused communication; (vi) focus on community directed benefits; and most importantly (vii) cultivate joy. From this framework, the P-CBSFA emerges to provide a multi-dimensional passageway through which lineal descendants of PuÃ¢â‚¬ËœuwaÃ¢â‚¬ËœawaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœa are formalizing governance and decision-making authority over their ancestral lands.

120,Diverse FamiliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Experiences with HPV Vaccine Information Sources: A Community-Based Participatory Approach,"Current sources of publicly available human papillomavirus (HPV) information may not adequately meet the needs of diverse families. This study sought to describe associations between sociodemographic and acculturation factors, and sources of HPV information among diverse parents and caregivers. Community organizations purposively recruited participants from African American, African refugee, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities for a 21-item survey (N = 228). Ninenty-three of these participants also participated in ten focus groups conducted in three languages. Descriptive statistics and FishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Exact Test for Count Data were produced and triangulated with focus group data to provide additional context. Overall, HPV vaccine awareness and knowledge in the five communities was low. This study found that a greater proportion of lower-acculturated participants had heard of HPV through personal networks (foreign-born = 50 % vs US-born = 30 %, p < 0.05; medium acculturation = 60 % vs high acculturation = 26 %, p = 0.01), while greater proportions of US-born participants reported media sources (49 % vs foreign-born = 29 %, p < 0.05). Across communities, healthcare system sources were described as important and preferred sources of HPV information. Hearing about the HPV vaccine from healthcare settings was significantly associated with increased accuracy in HPV vaccine knowledge (p < 0.05). Communities described a need for more in-depth information about the HPV vaccine, and culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials.

122,Customary sea tenure in Oceania as a case of rights-based fishery management: Does it work?,"This paper outlines the general characteristics of customary sea tenure (CST) in Oceania and identifies areas in which these characteristics overlap with modern rights-based fisheries management systems such as ITQs and CDQs. It also examines the effectiveness of CST regimes at regulating marine resource use and access by focusing on a particular case from the Solomon Islands. The institutional robustness or vulnerability of CST is assessed by examining various performance criteria for two communities in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomons. These criteria include people's (1) settlement patterns in relation to their property, (2) cultural consensus, (3) cultural attitudes with regard to governance and management, and (4) fishing efforts and yields. The results show that a number of historical processes have shaped CST systems into heterogeneous and dynamic institutions, and that CST regimes can vary even on small geographical scales. Understanding the circumstances in which CST regimes are more likely to be successful has facilitated the design and implementation of co-management fishery prescriptions (MPAs) for protecting particular species and habitats in the region. More generally, the paper proposes that by discerning the effectiveness of local governance institutions at regulating resource use and access - taking into consideration that these are embedded in particular historical and political contexts - we can better predict whether or not an introduced fishery management system will work. This knowledge can also assist in designing hybrid management schemes that cross-fertilize community-based management, modern rights-based fishery management (e.g., ITQs and CDQs), and other government regulations. This integration is particularly relevant when these policies are to be implemented in coastal communities that have or have had traditional rights-based fishery management systems of their own and/or are more socio-culturally homogeneous. Given the long history of failed fishery management, it is now of vital importance to design innovative fishery management prescriptions that integrate natural and social science research more comprehensively.

123,New valuation for defying degradation: Visualizing mangrove forest dynamics and local stewardship with remote sensing in coastal Ecuador,"Coastal mangrove forests have been undervalued and converted to other uses throughout the developing world for almost half a century. The causes and consequences of mangrove deforestation have been well-documented; however fewer studies have examined the political factors contributing to conservation and the social dimensions of habitat restoration. We combine remote sensing analysis with ethnographic research to quantify patterns of mangrove cover change between 1985 and 2014, and to qualitatively explore local observations and testimonies of conflict over resources in the JambelÃƒÂ­ Archipelago, Ecuador. Our results reveal that shrimp aquaculture was a pervasive force shaping spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove cover change from 1985 to 1999. Thereafter, trends of deforestation decelerated to reveal signs of recovery in some locations due to new policies, institutional transformations at multiple levels, and local commitment to community mangrove reforestation. Our research suggests that sustained local commitment to stewardship emerged from local discontent with historically ineffective policies that permitted a struggle between artisanal fishers and shrimp farmers over resources and territory. This context shaped the evolution of policy and provided a ripe environment for successful community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in 2000 when the Ecuadorian government began granting collective stewardship rights to artisanal fishers and other Ã¢â‚¬Å“ancestral user groupsÃ¢â‚¬Â for mangrove conservation. We conclude that the state's empowerment of artisanal fishers with resource rights served as a critical turning point toward more socially just policies with transformative impacts on previously degraded mangrove landscapes.

125,Low Impact Development (LID) retrofit atrategies for CSO controls,"Abstract only available. This project is a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to demonstrate the potential for community-based planning for the development of CSO controls in conjunction with large-scale community redevelopment projects. One of the challenges concerning the use of LID in urban areas is that citizens' groups and property owners are often more concerned with the appearance of the neighborhood and economic development than with spending resources on water quality retrofits. Water quality planners must therefore balance the community's goals with the expectations of developers, land use planners, and stakeholders concerning the integration of BMPs into the infrastructure. The Anacostia section of Washington, D.C. is the focus of a large-scale redevelopment effort. The project focuses on how LID controls can be integrated into the master plan for Anacostia, and how customized strategies and techniques can be developed to address the master plan vision of the project. The effectiveness of different approaches was modeled to determine the optimal combination(s) of LID landscape and building practices that can be incorporated into the plans in order to meet regulatory and water quality objectives. Different scenarios were explored, including water conservation and harvesting, green roofs, and other structural and non-structural controls. The Prince George's County BMP Evaluation Module was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the systems. Another focus of the project is on how to construct and maintain these systems to insure their long-term success. This includes private and public partnerships, overlay zones, financial incentives, and business improvement districts to maintain the long-term viability of the facilities.

126,"Fisheries biology, assessment and management: Second edition","This excellent second edition of Fisheries Biology, Assessment and Management, has been fully updated and expanded, providing a book which is an essential purchase for students and scientists studying, working or researching in fisheries and aquatic sciences. In the same way that excessive hunting on land has threatened terrestrial species, excessive fishing in the sea has reduced stocks of marine species to dangerously low levels. In addition, the ecosystems that support coastal marine species are threatened by habitat destruction, development and pollution. Open access policies and subsidised fishing are placing seafood in danger of becoming a scarce and very expensive commodity for which there is an insatiable demand. Positive trends include actions being taken to decrease the incidental catches of non-target species, consumer preferences for seafood from sustainable fisheries, and the establishment of no-take areas that provide refuges for marine species. But there is an urgent need to do more. Because there is an increasing recognition of the need to manage ecosystems as well as fish stocks, this second edition of this bestselling text book includes an additional chapter on marine ecology. Chapters on parameter estimation and stock assessment now include step-by-step instructions on building computer spreadsheet models, including simulations with random variations that realistically emulate the vagaries of nature. Sections on ecosystem management, co-management, community-based management and marine protected areas have been expanded to match the increased interest in these areas. Containing many worked examples, computer programs and numerous high quality illustrations, Fisheries Biology, Assessment and Management, second edition, is a comprehensive and essential text for students worldwide studying fisheries, fish biology, aquatic and biological sciences. As well as serving as a core text for students, the book is a superb reference for fisheries and aquatic researchers, scientists and managers across the globe, in both temperate and tropical regions. Libraries in all universities where fish biology, fisheries, aquatic sciences and biological sciences are studied and taught will need copies of this most useful new edition on their shelves.

128,Perceptions matter: How fishermen's perceptions affect trends of sustainability in Indian fisheries,"Indian marine fisheries have expanded four-fold in the last 50 years in the form of open-access commons. Although studies predict that fish stocks are on the decline there is little evidence that these declines are being countered by changes in either fishing regulations or fishing practices. Fishermen rarely comply with regulations, instead operationalizing and directing the fishery on their own. In these circumstances understanding how fishermen perceive and use resources has significant management and policy implications. Our study examined fishermen's perceptions about the state of fish stocks and documents current fishing practice and management strategies in India. We surveyed 342 fishermen in two states, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. We found that 86% of fishermen perceived a decline in catch and 69% perceived a decline in bycatch. Fishermen adapt to these declines by increasing fishing area and time spent, changing their gear, and overlapping in fishing zones. The convoluted interactions between ineffective community and state regulations guiding their actions has prevented fishermen from developing successful models of sustainable fisheries management. We identified non-compliance with regulations and government incentives as an important livelihood opportunity. Non-compliance drives change in fishing practice by giving fishermen the flexibility to respond to perceived fish catch dynamics by modifying their practices. We recommend strengthening local fishing communities by enabling them to enforce fishing regulations locally and by scaling back of existing government incentives, to protect the sustainability of these fisheries.

129,"Review of status, threats, and conservation management options for the endangered Indus River blind dolphin","The Indus River dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor) is a freshwater cetacean that occurs only in the Indus River system in Pakistan and India. This review provides a comprehensive summary of issues surrounding Indus dolphin conservation, and includes a description of their distribution, the threats they face and a discussion of conservation and research activities, options and priorities. Information was gathered from published current and historical literature, newspaper articles, and unpublished reports. Prior to construction of the Indus Irrigation system dolphins occurred in 3500. km of the Indus River system. Their range has now declined by 80% due to fragmentation of river habitat by barrages and large-scale diversion of water for irrigated agriculture. The subspecies was estimated to number approximately 1450 individuals in 2011, and occurs in 6 subpopulations, three of which are probably too small to persist. There is an urgent need to evaluate whether dolphins move through barrages, as this has the potential to extirpate upstream subpopulations. Pre-requisites for dolphin translocations to combat this problem are outlined. Mortality in fishing gear and high levels of chemical pollution in water courses are both increasing threats exacerbated by depleted flows. Research and conservation priorities include maintenance of river flows, mortality monitoring, canal rescues and community-based conservation. Conservation and research action is urgently needed to prevent the Indus dolphin from succumbing to the same fate as the baiji.

130,"Contemporary approaches for small-scale oyster reef restoration to address substrate versus recruitment limitation: A review and comments relevant for the olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida carpenter 1864","Reefs and beds formed by oysters such as the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica and the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida Carpenter 1864 Ã¢â‚¬Â  were dominant features in many estuaries throughout their native ranges. Many of these estuaries no longer have healthy, productive reefs because of impacts from destructive fishing, sediment accumulation, pollution, and parasites. Once valued primarily as a fishery resource, increasing attention is being focused today on the array of other ecosystem services that oysters and the reefs they form provide in United States coastal bays and estuaries. Since the early 1990s efforts to restore subtidal and intertidal oyster reefs have increased significantly, with particular interest in small-scale community-based projects initiated most often by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). To date, such projects have been undertaken in at least 15 US states, for both species of dominant native oysters along the United States coast. Community-based restoration practitioners have used a broad range of nonmutually exclusive approaches, including: (1) oyster gardening of hatchery-produced oysters; (2) deployment of juvenile to adult shellfish (""broodstock"") within designated areas for stock enhancement; and (3) substrate enhancement using natural or recycled man-made materials loose or in ""bags"" designed to enhance local settlement success. Many of these approaches are inspired by fishery-enhancement efforts of the past, though are implemented with different outcomes in mind (ecological services vs. fishery outcomes). This paper was originally presented at the first West Coast Restoration Workshop in 2006 in San Rafael, California and is intended to summarize potential approaches for small-scale restoration projects, including some emerging methods, and highlight the logistical benefits and limitations of these approaches. Because the majority of the past efforts have been with C. viriginica, we use those examples initially to highlight efforts with the intent of enlightening current west coast United States efforts with Ostrea lurida. We also discuss site-specific characteristics including ""recruitment bottlenecks"" and ""substrate limitation"" as criteria for identifying the most appropriate approaches to use for small-scale restoration projects. Many of the included ""lessons-learned"" from the smaller-scale restoration projects being implemented today can be used to inform not only large-scale estuary wide efforts to restore C. virginica, but also the relatively nascent efforts directed at restoring the United States west coast's native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida.",NA,No,The paper does not include a case study from any of the specified locations.," No; The abstract and title do not mention any of the specified locations.

131,Ecological quality assessment of small estuaries from the Portuguese coast based on fish assemblages indices,"The importance of establishing the ecological quality of estuarine systems has been widely acknowledged and led to the development of several fish community-based multimetric indices. Nevertheless, a question rose about the accuracy of these tools when natural disturbance is acting upon the organization of the systems' communities. Four multimetric indices were used to examine their ability to differentiate the ecological status of five small estuarine systems (southern Portugal), and also to test if they reflected the level of anthropogenic pressures. Fish assemblages from Mira, Odeceixe and Aljezur (in the Southwest coast), GilÃƒÂ£o and Bensafrim (in the South coast) estuaries were sampled seasonally for one year, and anthropogenic sources of pressure were identified and quantified. We found that although the applied indices provided information on ecological condition differentiation among systems, they are unable to explain different classes of ecological status in systems with equivalent pressure levels.

132,"Gender and marine protected areas: a case study of Danajon Bank, Philippines","In this paper, we examine the role of gender in community-based management of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Central Philippines. MPAs are a common conservation and fisheries management tool in this area, but the relationship between gendered fishing practices and participatory MPA management is rarely considered. In this region, women and menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fishing practices are often socially and ecologically distinct. MPAs are found in both intertidal and subtidal areas where women and men tend to fish respectively. Based on over 500 interviews in 12 fishing communities, MPAs were largely perceived to be a management tool for menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fishing. Very few men and women reported a negative effect on their personal fishing or displacement from their fishing area. However, in two communities MPAs that had been in intertidal areas had either been moved or opened specifically to allow for gleaning. Women were less likely than men to report that the MPA had a positive effect on their fishing, but women and men recommended the MPA in equal numbers. Women and men reported attending MPA meetings, but women were less likely to describe active participation in MPA management such as decision making. This research adds to the larger body of work that considers gender and inequality to critically examine issues of power and exclusion in community-based resource management.

134,A network of small community-owned village fish reserves in Samoa,"Under a community-based fisheries extension programme in Samoa, 44 coastal villages have developed their own village fisheries management plans. Each plan sets out the resource management and conservation undertakings of the community, and the servicing and technical support required from the governÃ‚Â­ ment fisheries division. Community undertakings range from enforcing laws banning destructive fishing methods to protecting critical habitats such as mangrove areas. An unexpectedly large number of villages (38) chose to estabÃ‚Â­ lish small village fish reserves in part of their traditional fishing areas. Although by social necessity many of the community-owned reserves are small, their large number, often with small separating distances, forms a network of fish refuges. Such a network may maximize linking of larval sources and suitable settlement areas and provide the means by which adjacent fishing areas are eventually replenished with marine species through reproduction and migraÃ‚Â­ tion. As the fish reserves are managed by communities which have a direct interest in their continuation and success, prospects for continuing compliÃ‚Â­ ance and commitment appear high. Results confirm our belief that the responsible management of marine resources will be achieved only when fishing communities themselves accept it as their responsibility.

135,The politics of mediation: Local-global interactions in the Central Amazon of Brazil,"The proliferation of a nongovernmental sector held the promise of linking local actors with national and international ones, thereby contributing to a highly participatory, Habermasian ideal in which the formerly marginalized would find greater participation and expression.

In addressing these issues in this article, I consider the roles of different interlocutors in two contrastive phases in an Amazonian community's movement to preserve its endangered fisheries. The comparative exercise demonstrates how institutional agents, by establishing a discourse that structures the criteria through which collective demands may be problematized, may inadvertently shift from mediation to domination, and from local partnering to local production.

137,Local management of mangrove forests in the Philippines: Successful conservation or efficient resource exploitation?,"Recent environmental ""narratives"" suggest that local people are effective stewards of forest resources. Local restoration and management of mangrove forests, in particular, are now widely advocated as a solution to achieve both economic and environmental conservation goals. This paper presents findings from a study of 2 coastal sites in the Philippines that are renowned and often showcased as success stories in community-based, mangrove reforestation and management. These cases are especially intriguing because local tree planting and management emerged in both areas long before governments and nongovernment organizations began to promote such activities. These management systems are a successful economic innovation in that planted mangroves protect homes and fish pond dykes from wave and wind damage, and the production of high-value construction wood is dramatically enhanced through intensive plantation management. Mangrove plantations are an efficient alternative to harvesting from unplanted, natural mangroves and their spread may reduce harvesting pressures on existing forests. However, mangrove plantations are structurally and compositionaly very different from unplanted forests, a finding of particular concern given that such plantations are increasingly encroaching into and replacing natural forests. Furthermore, planted forests are not typically viewed by planters in terms of their environmental conservation values and are frequently cut and cleared to make space for alternative uses, especially fish farming and residential settlement. The suggestion that these local mangrove management systems are successful for conservation thus needs to be qualified.

In this study, we present the field methods used by Projeto TAMAR-IBAMA (the Brazilian Sea Turtle Conservation Program) in the state of Espirito Santo and analyze data on leatherback nesting from 1988-1989 to 2003-2004. In that period, 527 nests were observed in the study area. The annual number of nests varied between 6 (in 1993-1994) and 92 (in 2002-2003). Between 1995-1996 and 2003-2004, the annual number of nests increased at about 20.4% per year on average. Among the 527 clutches observed, 358 (67.9%) were left in situ, 50 (9.5%) were relocated to another spot on the beach, 88 (16.7%) were relocated to open-air beach hatcheries, and 31 clutches (5.9%) did not have their management decision recorded.

139,Northwest Forest Plan - The fist 10 years (1994-2003): Socioeconomic monitoring of Coos Bay district and three local communities,"This case study examines the socioeconomic changes that took place between 1990 and 2000 in and around lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Coos Bay District in southwestern Oregon for purposes of assessing the effects of the Northwest Forest Plan (the Plan) on rural economies and communities in the Coos Bay region. The case study included an analysis of changes in the district's programs, as well as socioeconomic changes that occurred within the communities of Coos Bay, Myrtle Point, and Reedsport. Data were gathered during 2003 and 2004 from multiple sources including U.S. census databases, county and state criminal justice and economic development databases, and BLM annual reports. Interviews with BLM employees and community residents provided additional insights on how the Plan affected local socioeconomic conditions and the district's interactions with local communities. The study indicates that by the time the record of decision for the Plan was signed, the Coos Bay region's timber sector had already lost a substantial portion of the wood products processing capacity and employment opportunities. Additionally, the changes in socioeconomic conditions that took place in the mid and late 1990s - an outflow of younger workers, inmigration of older workers and retirees, school closures, increased levels of educational attainment, declines in manufacturing sectors, and expansion of the services sector - are changes that took place during the same period in rural communities across much of the Western United States. It is thus likely that the types of overall socioeconomic changes observed in the Coos Bay region between 1990 and 2004 would have occurred with or without the Plan. Owing to legal challenges, the Coos Bay District was unable to provide a steady and predictable supply of timber from 1994 onward. District foresters shifted their focus toward developing thinning techniques for density management of stands less than 80 years old. Barring legal action, sales from these younger stands will enable the district to provide a predictable supply of smaller diameter timber in future years. In the post-Plan years, the Coos Bay District also significantly expanded its capacity to carry out multiple-use land management. It played a key role in community-based watershed restoration and recreation and tourism development efforts. As a result, the district is now in a much better position to provide the public, including residents of local communities, with a broad array of forest values and opportunities (i.e., improved fish habitat, more recreation sites, more cultural sites, etc.). Key factors in the success of post-Plan community-district partnerships included ongoing and substantial support from upper level leadership, a stable district budget (in marked contrast to the budget declines in neighboring national forests), and a relatively stable staffing level (in contrast to the downsizing that occurred in neighboring national forests).",NA,No,"The case study is based in Oregon, USA, not in any of the Pacific Island nations specified in the screening criteria."," No; The paper is focused on a case study in southwestern Oregon, not any of the listed Pacific Island nations.

140,Promoting community-based surveillance of economically important invasive species in lower-income economies: a case study of the suckermouth catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) in Bangladesh,"The distribution of invasive species in lower-income economies is relatively poorly understood, and many countries do not actively curate a list of species invasions or have programs to monitor or mitigate the effects of non-native species within their borders. Methods leveraging new technologies and expanding access to the internet may offer the opportunity to support low-cost and large-scale monitoring efforts. Here, we demonstrate how the use of online news coverage can support initial attempts to map the distribution of an economically-important, non-native freshwater fish in Bangladesh (Ptergoplichthys sp.), which is native to tropical regions of South America. By initiating new collaborations between the scientific and online journalism communities, governments and organizations may be able to enhance their abilities to map the distribution of non-native species and develop new programs to support public awareness of species invasion at relatively low cost.

141,"From community-based to co-management: Improvement or deterioration in fisheries governance in the Cherai Poyil fishery in the Cochin Estuary, Kerala, India?","During the last 50 years, several different forms of fisheries governance have been tried and failed in the Cochin Estuary, Kerala, India. The latest shift has been from a community-based system to a co-management system, and this paper evaluates the current system in the light of the theoretical debate over the respective merits of community-based management and co-management. The paper is based on documentary material and data from interviews carried out during fieldwork in 2004, from which it concludes that provided the co-management system incorporates community principles within it, it will be an effective form of fisheries governance.

142,Participatory fishing community assessments to support coral reef fisheries comanagement,"Comanagement of natural resources involves shared management authority and responsibility between resource users or community groups at local levels and central government authorities. In data-poor, small-scale fisheries systems, community-based planning efforts can be informed by participatory research approaches that involve community members and stakeholder groups in the design, development, and implementation of research. This article draws upon research in Maunalua Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i, to illustrate the utility of participatory assessments in communities, institutions, and organizations as they transition toward comanagement arrangements. A community-led survey effort revealed temporal changes in habitat use patterns and declines in key fisheries species and habitats. Fishing activities in Maunalua Bay are primarily noncommercial in nature and many of the direct benefits from local fisheries are distributed through social-kinship networks. The fishing community exhibited a high capacity for engagement in community-based planning efforts and also provided input on proposed management measures. The article concludes by documenting the social and environmental factors that influence the distribution of coral reef fisheries ecosystem services, and assessing sliding baselines among community fishers. Participatory resource assessments hold promise for building local social adaptive capacity, bringing together disparate stakeholder groups, and building place-based natural resource management plans reflective of local contexts and community priorities.

143,Climate change adaptation governance in Nepal: A framework for sustainable generationof adaptation services,"Poverty and high dependency of rural and mountainous households on the natural resources of Nepal have made the country more vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand,there is inadequacy of adaptation services provided to the vulnerable households and ecosystems. Responding to climate change necessitates a more consolidated effort and effective implementation interventions from both the government and non-government actors. To help achieve this very essence, this study has aimed to-(i) review the existing climate change adaptation (CCA)practices, processes and patterns of sustainable resource mobilization and benefit sharing, and (ii) develop a framework that ensures sustainability of resources and equitable sharing of services and benefits accrued from CCA. Consultations with the communities, key state and non-state stakeholders both at federal and provincial levels, reviews of national policies, strategies, periodic plans and programs and field visits were carried out to synthesize the information, document the knowledge, and highlight the gaps pertaining to CCA. Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) was executed for analyzing qualitative information. Recently, the Government of Nepal has developed a priority framework on sustainable resource management and delivery of adaptation services. In line with the eight themes identified by the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP, 2019), the proposed framework has paid central attention on medium and long-term adaptation planning adhered with Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and Community-based Adaptation (CbA). Building resilience, reducing vulnerability, increasing capacities, enabling environment, and integrating CCA in development planning have been the focus of the framework. It is found that the delivery of adaptation services to the climate vulnerable groups and poor communities is well reached out through CbA and EbA approaches. It is therefore, crucial in strengthening community- and locally-based mechanisms (such as forest-user groups, farmers groups, agricultural and fisheries cooperatives, and community networks) for sustainable management and delivery of services to facilitate effective adaptation.

144,Virtual population units: A new institutional approach to fisheries management,"This paper describes an alternative, rights-based approach to the economic problems of fisheries management and governance. The approach is based on the concept of a Virtual Population (VP), which provides an alternative way to define use rights in a fishery management system. Included is a comparison of harvest rates under the VP regime, ""sole-owner,"" and open-access regimes. In comparison, a VP solution is more efficient than open access and can approach that of a sole owner. More importantly, in our opinion, the approach contains a higher degree of local control over issues such as concentration of ownership and, unlike some community-based systems, provides an explicit, decentralized incentive for conservation. It also contains a built-in incentive mechanism for end-of-year conservation that is absent from individual transferable quotas (ITQs).

145,Vulnerability of nearshore tropical finfish in Cuba: implications for scientific and management planning,"Coastal areas of Cuba harbor rich biodiversity that provide a variety of important ecosystem services, including fisheries production. High-value invertebrate fisheries in Cuba are managed on the basis of scientific assessments, but comparable data and analyses are lacking for the much larger number of exploited finfish species. However, dramatic declines in finfish catch despite minimal management restrictions suggests resource depletion, and the need for scientific and management attention. To prioritize finfish for such attention, we conducted productivity-susceptibility analyses (PSA) for 34 species within each of CubaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four fishery management zones. The resulting 136 estimates of vulnerability to overfishing revealed few differences in species-specific scores among zones, despite ecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity along the Cuban coast. Vulnerability scores were generally low, although this relative metric does not necessarily mean that overfishing has not occurred. Spatial differences in catch composition relative to the vulnerability scores underscore potential differences in socioeconomic vulnerability of fishing communities based upon their reliance on different species. Therefore, our PSA results should be used to prioritize research, monitoring, and stock assessment efforts, as well as management actions, within each fishing zone to conserve locally important resources, recover those that are depleted, sustainably develop those that are underutilized, and promote ecological and socioeconomic stability across Cuba as it confronts the challenges of a changing world.

146,Teens could get new message on waiting for sex. Sex education.,"It's best to wait until you are older to have sex. But if you decide to have intercourse, use a condom. We'll show you how. That's the message most New Jersey teens get in their sex education classes. It's the law. But a new source of federal funding could help advocates of ""abstinence-only"" education find a way around that requirement. The state Department of Health and Senior Services is considering whether to apply for federal money limited to programs teaching teens that abstinence is the only certain way to prevent pregnancy and avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The federally funded programs also would have to teach that sex before marriage is morally wrong. About $50 million for these abstinence-only programs was quietly tucked into the welfare bill that President Clinton signed into law in 1996. New Jersey is eligible to receive $843,000. The health department is hearing from people on both sides of the issue, said Celeste Wood, who plans to submit a report to Health Commissioner Len Fishman by the end of the month. Fishman will then decide whether New Jersey should apply for the money, she said. Historically, debate between ""comprehensive"" and ""abstinence-only"" sex education has centered around the classroom and education department. Comprehensive programs teach both abstinence and contraception. Abstinence-only programs prohibit discussion of contraception. Comprehensive education advocates have won that battle in New Jersey public schools. The state's core curriculum standards currently call for schools to teach teens about both abstinence and contraception. But the new federal money is being funneled through state health departments. ""This skates around the schools by bringing the money in through the public health arena,"" said Daniel Daley, director of public policy for the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the US. ""They are trying to influence community-based programs and make an end-run around the schools.""

147,Statistical power: an important consideration in designing community-based monitoring programs for Arctic and sub-Arctic subsistence fisheries,"Polar communities and management agencies require well-designed monitoring systems to determine whether harvesting is biologically sustainable. While it is known that life history traits such as length-at-age and fecundity will vary with population density, cost-efficient monitoring requires that these metrics be incorporated into monitoring programs only if their statistical power is high to detect change due to fishing. We present a simple computer-simulated power analysis technique to compare the ability of monitoring designs to detect changes in fish length-at-age and fecundity, after adding effects of exploitation. We developed a methodology for estimating statistical power from first principles using computer simulation techniques which can be applied regardless of the statistical variance pattern in the data. Statistical power increased when more fish were sampled and when larger effects were added. Initially, power increased rapidly by increasing the sample size, regardless of the effect added. However, after 40Ã¢â‚¬â€œ50 fish were included in the sample, smaller increments of increased power were obtained; highlighting that a cost-benefit analysis would be necessary. When compared to exploitation experiments in the literature, the stock-specific power analysis used here was able to correctly predict the outcome (significant change observed or not) of the literature studies in most cases. This technique advances the ability of designers of monitoring programs to assess the efficiency of any type of monitoring metric. Further, the simplicity of this power analysis technique allows it to be tailored to different species, life history traits, or potential disturbances to the population.

148,"The role of religion in coastal resource management: The case of kupo island, penghu (pescadores), Taiwan","This article discusses changing lover (seaweed) collection management strategies by devotees of a temple in Chikan Village, Penghu (Pescadores), and the successful transition from a declining local economic business into a lucrative recreational activity. With nearly a hundred years of experience, a temple committee of Chikan has managed to firmly maintain its control on the collection of laver on the nearby island of Kupo. Originally based on the ideology of patriarchy, the management committee of the temple has designed a particular system of laver collection for each local household. Nevertheless, the migration of male residents has been a blow to the local economy, necessitating modifications to the traditional old management system of laver collection. In cooperation with the cultural agency of Penghu County, the temple committee initiated a popular festival in 1996 to encourage all youth nationwide to join in the activities of laver collection. This article concludes that the Chikan case demonstrates the valuable function of a religious organization in the community-based involvement of coastal resource management. It also reveals that setting forth an active and flexible approach to deal with a changing society is essential. Moreover, environmental education vis-ÃƒÂ -vis coastal resources in relation to recreational activities can encourage fuller participation from the younger generation as well as the public at large.

150,Participatory research supporting community-based fishery management,"This paper reports on a project to engage researchers and fishers together in adapting social science approaches to the purposes and the constraints of community-based fisher organizations. The work was carried out in the Scotia-Fundy Region of Atlantic Canada (the Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf). Its rationale reflects arguments that (1) effective community-based management requires that managers are able to pose and address social science questions, (2) participatory research, involving true cooperation in all stages, can support this process, and (3) there is a need to overcome practical and methodological barriers faced in developing participatory research protocols, to serve the needs of community-based management while not demanding excessive transaction costs. In this paper, we report on work with fisher organizations, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal, in which social science priorities were set by each organization, and small-scale research projects designed and carried out to meet these needs. This work identified interests among fishers in research on three different levels of meaning: (1) practical livelihood concerns, including what, when and where to fish, and with what intensity of effort, (2) social, economic and political issues (e.g., on institutional structures, politics of access and allocation, overlap and conflict between regulatory regimes), and (3) values and ethics that implicitly or explicitly guide policy development and implementation. Several research themes proved crucial, including those of power sharing, defining boundaries of a community-based group, access and equity, designing effective management plans, enforcement, and scaling up for effective regional and ecosystem-wide management. The research results demonstrate the effectiveness of extending participatory methods to challenge traditional scientific notions of the research process. Ã‚Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Uganda.,"In 1991, Medecins sans Frontieres initiated an HIV/AIDS prevention program in Moyo District, Uganda, with the goal of gradually transferring responsibility for it to local people through the training of AIDS control advisors (ACA). Informational pamphlets were developed along with an action plan for a village-based information campaign, followed by the insertion of 8 women and 22 men into a two-week training course in Moyo Town on prevention measures and communication. The ACAs were evaluated monthly both qualitatively and quantitatively with an overall evaluation conducted in January 1992. All villages had been visited several times in the first five months, with the ACAs meeting 50,000 people and distributing 45,000 pamphlets and 40,000 condoms. Community collaboration was excellent, although condoms were distributed to only adults and older teenagers in response to local cries that condom distribution encouraged immorality. Some language difficulties were also encountered. ACAs continued to distribute condoms upon request over the period February-August 1992, but concentrated upon drivers, beer brewers and their customers, traders, musicians, soldiers, barmaids, fishermen, teachers and school children, traditional healers and birth attendants, and religious leaders. Subsequent to this period, the advisors received a week of training on conducting KAP surveys.

152,"Political ecology and social representations on mangrove conservation, rehabilitation and restoration in catanduanes island, philippines","Mangrove forest conservation, rehabilitation and restoration (or Ã¢â‚¬ËœmangrovizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as used in this paper) is practiced throughout the island province of Catanduanes in Luzon, Philippines to halt deforestation and degradation of coastal ecosystem and biodiversity. This study critically assesses mangrovization practices within the discourses on mangrove destruction and rehabilitation practices in this island using the lens of political ecology and MoscoviciÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theory of social representations emphasizing institutional arrangements and the community dynamics. Analysis was based on interviews with 61 respondents from four municipalities of Virac, San Andres, Caramoran and Baras having intact mangroves covered in the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ National Agriculture and Fisheries Extension System (NAFES) funded program SURMABIOCON of the Catanduanes State University (CSU). A huge majority of the population in the island live along the low elevation coastal zone and are experiencing and exposed to the effects of climate change and disasters as shown in typhoon occurrence, windiness, landslide, and tidal surges. The coasts of Catanduanes are predominantly shaped coastal changes, mangrove flora and beach forest vegetation which together provide protection against coastal erosion and trap sediments resulting in coastal accretion. Results of the study shows how formal and informal institutions created by both distinct stakeholder relations can lead to some success in mangrovization. There appears to be overlapping situations and inconsistencies in the implementation of science-based and community-based mangrovization programs in support of the overall coastal resource management (CRM) as outlined in local governance. Then need for state universities to be involved in mangrovization programs/projects/activities which center on decision-making power regarding science-based and community-based initiatives on how, where, and when mangrovization should be carried out, specifically on the location of replanting or restoring mangroves in the island. The strong LGU-community-academe institutional arrangement in the island provides better contribution to the success of mangrovization. Contemporary narratives from two progressive mangrovization projects having collaboration, cooperation, and monitoring schemes with the state university is central to the notion that these projects could lead to successes. The study demonstrates how weak stakeholders can become stronger in the implementation of mangrovization initiatives that begins with capacity building and strengthening academe-mangrove association partnerships thus leading to effective coastal governance, particularly on mangrove biodiversity conservation and mangrove rehabilitation and restoration in this island of Catanduanes.

154,Unfinished business: Taiwan's experience with rights-based coastal fisheries management,"This paper examines a case involving a mix of Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries, co-management and the competition for using coastal zones. In the 2000s, Taiwan's government initiated a remodeling of the fishery right system, which is a rights-based approach to fisheries management, as an attempt to address conflicts between fishers and developers regarding the use of coastal space and to put community-based co-management into practice. The paper particularly compares the system before and after 2000 and identifies areas of concern in the implementation of the remodeled system. The results show that the government's support for this system signifies progress in the right direction. However, concerns emerge, mostly involving fishers' low participation, fishermen's association's lack of technical skills and financial resources, and the division of management responsibility. The government is advised to play a more active role in dealing with these concerns. Finally, the paper reveals that the factor of competition for using coastal zones poses a challenge to co-management, and suggests a holistic view with integrated coastal management or marine spatial planning practices, for developing co-management under the fishery right system.

155,Using historical atlas data to develop high-resolution distribution models of freshwater fishes,"Understanding the spatial pattern of species distributions is fundamental in biogeography, and conservation and resource management applications. Most species distribution models (SDMs) require or prefer species presence and absence data for adequate estimation of model parameters. However, observations with unreliable or unreported species absences dominate and limit the implementation of SDMs. Presence-only models generally yield less accurate predictions of species distribution, and make it difficult to incorporate spatial autocorrelation. The availability of large amounts of historical presence records for freshwater fishes of the United States provides an opportunity for deriving reliable absences from data reported as presence-only, when sampling was predominantly community-based. In this study, we used boosted regression trees (BRT), logistic regression, and MaxEnt models to assess the performance of a historical metacommunity database with inferred absences, for modeling fish distributions, investigating the effect of model choice and data properties thereby. With models of the distribution of 76 native, non-game fish species of varied traits and rarity attributes in four river basins across the United States, we show that model accuracy depends on data quality (e.g., sample size, location precision), species' rarity, statistical modeling technique, and consideration of spatial autocorrelation. The cross-validation area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) tended to be high in the spatial presence-absence models at the highest level of resolution for species with large geographic ranges and small local populations. Prevalence affected training but not validation AUC. The key habitat predictors identified and the fish-habitat relationships evaluated through partial dependence plots corroborated most previous studies. The community-based SDM framework broadens our capability to model species distributions by innovatively removing the constraint of lack of species absence data, thus providing a robust prediction of distribution for stream fishes in other regions where historical data exist, and for other taxa (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates, birds) usually observed by community-based sampling designs.

156,Towards wise coastal management practice in a tropical megacity - Jakarta,"Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA) or Jabotabek is one of the most dynamic regions of Indonesia. At present, the JMA is the largest concentration of urban population in Indonesia and seventh largest urban agglomeration in the world. The massive demographic and economic growth taking place in the region have gone hand in hand with environmental destruction and poverty concentration. Jabotabek is experiencing a number of problems related to its coastal location: coastal littering, water pollution, saltwater intrusion, land subsidence, seafood contamination and the loss of habitat for birds, fish and other wild life. Poverty alleviation and the preservation of the coastal environment for sustainable development are becoming critical issues facing the Jabotabek. This is where the concept of wise coastal management practice becomes pertinent, where scientists and managers and local stakeholders co-operate in finding solutions to these various inter-related problems. A multiple-prong approach is employed to improve coastal environmental management among other: scientific campaign on coastal resources management, community-based development for sustainable coastal management including community-based waste management and recycling, social empowerment, and environmental education.

These elements, along with the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complex geologic history and geographic position, make the Philippines one of the most biologically diverse, most disaster prone, and most environmentally threatened in the world.

158,"Fishers' perceived objectives of community-based coastal resource management in the Kei islands, Indonesia","Community-based resource management is a key approach to achieve successful small-scale fisheries and marine conservation. Many local management initiatives worldwide have been successfully managing aquatic resources and livelihoods of communities depending on them. Community-based management is particularly prevalent in small tropical islands where communities are frequently heavily dependent on coral reef ecosystems and small-scale reef fisheries for their livelihoods. Community-based management is, however, not always a panacea since there are inherit trade-offs among multiple objectives which are sometimes accentuated by community heterogeneity. It is well recognized that perceived and real evidence of community benefits are key to attributing success to local community-based management. However, broader understanding of community-based management objectives and how fishers' perceived personal objectives and characteristics affect management outcomes remains limited. We apply a non-linear Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to explore variations in personally held community-based management objectives, based on local surveys for fishing communities in the Kei Islands in Indonesia. We then examine whether these variations also explain their perceptions of environmental and economic outcomes that are achieved by this management systems. In this study important differences are found in the perceptions fishers have of the relative importance of different community management objectives. The value people attribute to aspects of community management can be related to their socio-demographic characteristics and experienced fishers tend to focus more on environmental objectives. Given that strong links were found between community management outcomes and terrestrially based activities there is an opportunity to link in the terrestrial and coastal systems management and achieve multiple objective outcomes.

This population is subjected to traditional harvests from geographically dispersed communities including along the northern and eastern coasts of Australia, Indonesia and south-western Pacific nations. In Torres Strait, green turtle hunting is classed as a traditional fishery and is guaranteed by Australian legislation (Native Title Act 1993) and the Torres Strait Treaty between Australia and Papua New Guinea that aims to protect the traditional lifestyle of the region's indigenous peoples. To investigate the Islanders' thoughts and aspirations regarding marine turtle management, we interviewed hunters and Islander Elders from the Hammond Island community in the Kaurareg nation of Kaiwalagal. Although not the Traditional Owners of the Kaiwalagal sea country in which they live and hunt, Hammond Islanders wish to be involved in the management of resources on which they depend, including marine turtles. They considered community-based processes to be important, especially the application of (1) cultural norms to the development of tools to achieve compliance and enforcement within the community, and (2) consensus-based decision-making amongst hunters and elders within the community, with regard to the use of more formal rules. However, the need for co-operation with other communities and stakeholders across scales was also recognised, particularly with regard to enforcement. Our results suggest that co-management is likely to be a more appropriate approach for managing green turtles in Torres Strait than either community-based management or government-driven management.

161,Multiple water use as an approach for increased basin productivity and improved adaptation: A case study from Bangladesh,"This study, supported by the Challenge ProgramWater and Food (CPWF-Project 35), demonstrates the case of multiple-use of water through seasonal aquaculture interventions for improved rice-fish production systems in the Bangladesh floodplains. The project focused on community-based fish culture initiatives, increasingly adopted in the agro-ecological zones of the major floodplains of the Padma, Testa, and Brahmaputra basin. The productivity of water and fish is used as an indicator to explain this case.We hypothesize that seasonal aquaculture supported by the management of floodplains for multiple-use of water can significantly increase the productivity of rice-fish systems. Recognizing the need for innovative ways to manage human-dominated landscapes and climate-sensitive ecosystems such as floodplains, we have analysed seasonal aquaculture interventions along with local adaptation of water management strategies, including the consideration of groundwater mechanisms. The results, supported by quantitative analysis and qualitative arguments, demonstrate the significant contribution of seasonal aquaculture in improving the rice-fish production systems of the selected floodplain sites. This was achieved through the increased productivity of water and fish and the reduction of the risk posed by arsenic contamination. The study is also illustrative of the diversification in livelihood-generating activities to cope with the extended period of flooding cycle in the region. We highlight the value of multiple resource-use approaches to enhance the social and ecological resilience of floodplains, and the need to re-consider basin water management options to recognize the water requirements of other sources of food such as fish produced by capture fisheries and aquaculture.

162,A network of grassroots reserves protects tropical river fish diversity,"Intensive fisheries have reduced fish biodiversity and abundance in aquatic ecosystems worldwide1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3. Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo-takeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ marine reserves have become a cornerstone of marine ecosystem-based fisheries management4Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6, and their benefits for adjacent fisheries are maximized when reserve design fosters synergies among nearby reserves7,8. The applicability of this marine reserve network paradigm to riverine biodiversity and inland fisheries remains largely untested. Here we show that reserves created by 23 separate communities in ThailandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Salween basin have markedly increased fish richness, density, and biomass relative to adjacent areas. Moreover, key correlates of the success of protected areas in marine ecosystemsÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly reserve size and enforcementÃ¢â‚¬â€predict differences in ecological benefits among riverine reserves. Occupying a central position in the network confers additional gains, underscoring the importance of connectivity within dendritic river systems. The emergence of network-based benefits is remarkable given that these reserves are young (less than 25 years old) and arose without formal coordination. Freshwater ecosystems are under-represented among the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protected areas9, and our findings suggest that networks of small, community-based reserves offer a generalizable model for protecting biodiversity and augmenting fisheries as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rivers face unprecedented pressures10,11.

163,Design principles for managing coastal fisheries commons in present-day Japan,"Ostrom (1990) challenged the traditional belief that commons management inevitably requires state ownership or privatization and instead established the notion of user self-governance. This notion, a third policy option for managing the commons, entails little or no state involvement. Under this notion, Ostrom developed eight design principles to which self-governing institutional arrangements adhere, while the role of the state is minimal. This article seeks to establish whether design principles characterize such institutional arrangements when the role of the state is accommodated explicitly within the principles. Drawing on a case study of present-day management of Japan's community-based coastal fisheries commons, our study shows that the design principles can better characterize self-governing institutional arrangements when the state adopts a pro-user self-governance role that provides strategic support for users, but neither takes ownership of the commons nor participates in engineering the institutional arrangements.

164,Co-management and spatial features contribute to secure fish abundance and fishing yields in tropical floodplain lakes,"Empirical data are needed to show the efficacy of co-management, which is regarded as a promising approach to achieve conservation goals. In this study, we addressed the potential influence of fisheries co-management to increase fish abundance and fishing yields in the lower Tocantins River Basin (Brazilian Amazon), downstream from a large dam. We analyzed 590 fish landings (6.7 t of fish) from five fishing villages and 48 fish samples obtained using gillnets (10,378 fish from 101 species) in 12 floodplain lakes in four regions: two with incipient co-management and two unmanaged. The fish species richness did not differ among the regions, but the lakes in the regions that were co-managed had higher fish abundance (biomass and number of individuals) and a higher mean proportion of fish reproducing during the high water season. Fishers had higher catches per unit of effort in the co-managed regions than fishers in the non-managed regions. These results were also influenced by geographic factors (distance and accessibility of lakes), as fish biomass was higher in lakes that were distant from the main river and from the main city in the region. Managers should thus consider strategic selection of the geographic locations of managed sites, even in remote areas. However, the fish biomass sampled in lakes was more related to region than to the lakes' geographical location. Therefore, co-management has at least partially contributed to increased fish abundance and fishing yields in the studied region, through the protection of an important fish habitat (lakes). We provide empirical evidence that co-management can contribute to the maintenance of fish abundance, sustainability of fisheries, and food security in large tropical rivers impacted by damming.

165,Community-Based Management of Amazonian Biodiversity Assets,"The Amazon is the largest forest system on Earth, supporting a variety of indigenous societies, small farmers, extractivists, and artisanal fishers with different cultures and relations with wildlife. However, the Brazilian Amazon has lost more than 436, 000 km2 of forest in the last 30 years, and Protected Areas may not be enough to ensure the conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage. On the other hand, formal alliances with rural inhabitants can decentralize resource management, strengthen full-time surveillance systems, reduce overall costs, and boost conservation effectiveness. Here, we provide an assessment of the two largest community-based management (CBM) programs in the Brazilian Amazon, which are inducing strong social and ecological benefits at a large scale. First, we show the benefits from CBM of giant arapaima, which has promoted an impressive stock recovery of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest freshwater scaled fish (Arapaima spp.), generating income and other benefits for rural livelihoods in Amazonian floodplains. Second, we show that CBM of freshwater turtles (Podocnemis spp.) has also promoted the population recovery of overexploited turtles, contributing to the maintenance of important cultural values. We also identified a set of social and institutional principles, and the intrinsic values of natural resources, which can help develop successful CBM programs. Finally, we discuss how these principles can strengthen existing initiatives and/or inspire new ones. Reconciling biodiversity conservation and local aspirations for rural development is an urgent socioecological demand in Amazonia. Raising the profile of successful initiatives can be a powerful strategy to disseminate a message of hope and action to local and international agencies that can support the scaling up of these successful models.

166,The Sociopolitical Economics of Marine Ranching Program in Korea,"This paper aims at overviewing Korean fisheries profile with a view on why Korean fisheries need marine ranching program as a new fisheries paradigm - a community-based co-management approach and drawing some policy implications from the advanced experience in fisheries. The aims of community-based co-management approach as a planned approach can be set out under the planning objectives of efficiency and equity. In this context Tongyeong marine ranching program is an important government-sponsored pilot enterprise. Experiences in the advanced fisheries such as Canadian Snow-Crab case suggest that in order to be successful for marine ranching be successful it is necessary that (i) there should be high-value species, (ii) property right should be established, (iii) there should be the reasonable number of participants involved, (iv) the participants and the government should be able to share resource enhancement/management/utilization responsibilities and associated fisheries management expenses. Among these, management cost sharing based on the practical partnership between fishing communities and government is of particular importance because the government must have a full responsibility for all ranching program expenditure unless revenues sufficient to guarantee reasonable income and to share management cost are generated from the ranching business.",NA,No,The paper is about Korea's marine ranching program and does not involve a case study from any of the specified countries.," No; The paper is focused on the marine ranching program in Korea, not any of the specified countries.

167,Multilevel governance and fisheries commons: Investigating performance and local capacities in rural Bangladesh,"This study presents a post-facto evaluation of the local capacity development processes used under co-management of fisheries and other resources of southern Bangladesh. It answers the question of how supportive were the capacity development tools used in implementing co-management. An 18 month study was conducted and six cases were investigated to understand the approaches to co-management programs used to develop local capacity. Founded in pragmatism and viewing co-management through a governance lens, a comparative case study method was used that combined both qualitative and quantitative research approaches for data collection and subsequent analysis. This study provides empirical evidence that co-management programs have applied a number of strategies (e.g. human resource and economic development) to enhance local capacities. However, these strategies have achieved mixed results with regard to developing governance that supports livelihoods. Training provided to develop human resources and economic capacity were not useful for fishers or had little lasting effects on fisheries development due to poor monitoring and a disconnection with the needs of local users. This study concludes that co-management can facilitate local capacity but in order to realize the full potential of this approach we must address the issues of inappropriate technologies for training, the financial barriers to fishers with low cash income, and uneven power relationships among stakeholders, to create an enabling environment for effective modern governance of the fisheries commons. Our findings indicate a needs-based approach to capacity building is needed in order to support the livelihoods of local users through co-management.

168,Context matters in understanding the vulnerability of women: perspectives from southwestern Uganda,"Background: Vulnerability at the individual, family, community or organization level affects access and utilization of health services, and is a key consideration for health equity. Several frameworks have been used to explore the concept of vulnerability and identified demographics including ethnicity, economic class, level of education, and geographical location. While the magnitude of vulnerable populations is not clearly documented and understood, specific indicators, such as extreme poverty, show that vulnerability among women is pervasive. Women in low and middle-income countries often do not control economic resources and are culturally disadvantaged, which exacerbates other vulnerabilities they experience. In this commentary, we explore the different understandings of vulnerability and the importance of engaging communities in defining vulnerability for research, as well as for programming and provision of maternal newborn and child health (MNCH) services. Methodology: In a recent community-based qualitative study, we examined the healthcare utilization experiences of vulnerable women with MNCH services in rural southwestern Uganda. Focus group discussions were conducted with community leaders and community health workers in two districts of Southwestern Uganda. In addition, we did individual interviews with women living in extreme poverty and having other conventional vulnerability characteristics. Findings and discussion: We found that the traditional criteria of vulnerability were insufficient to identify categories of vulnerable women to target in the context of MNCH programming and service provision in resource-limited settings. Through our engagement with communities and through the narratives of the people we interviewed, we obtained insight into how nuanced vulnerability can be, and how important it is to ground definitions of vulnerability within the specific context. We identified additional aspects of vulnerability through this study, including: women who suffer from alcoholism or have husbands with alcoholism, women with a history of home births, women that have given birth only to girls, and those living on fishing sites. Conclusion: Engaging communities in defining vulnerability is critical for the effective design, implementation and monitoring of MNCH programs, as it ensures these services are reaching those who are most in need.

169,The Finnmark Intervention Study: Is it possible to change CVD risk factors by community-based intervention in an Arctic village in crisis?,"Aims: Owing to high cardiovascular mortality, the Norwegian Government introduced the programme Ã¢â‚¬Å“Health and Inequalities in FinnmarkÃ¢â‚¬Â in 1988. One of the projects in this programme was aimed at changing cardiovascular risk factors through community-based intervention in a fishing community in the Norwegian Arctic. Methods: The intervention community BÃƒÂ¥tsfjord and the three control communities were selected from the same coastal area. The intervention was based on a quasi-experimental design, and evaluated by population surveys before (1987) and after (1993) the invention. The attending cohort was analysed. The intervention method was based on empowerment and cooperation between different organizations, and the primary healthcare system. Results: From 1987-93, the male cohort in BÃƒÂ¥tsfjord had a more favourable development when compared with changes in the control communities regarding the 8.6% increase in physical activity (p=0.047), the reduction in systolic blood pressure by 0.01 mmHg (p=0.002), and the reduction in diastolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmHg (p<0.001). The female cohort in BÃƒÂ¥tsfjord had a more favourable development when compared with changes in the control communities regarding the 11.2% increase in use of low-fat milk (p=0.046), the increase in systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmHg (p=0.024), and the reduction in diastolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmHg (p<0.001).

170,Predicting impact to assess the efficacy of community-based marine reserve design,"During the planning phase the efficacy of different strategies to manage marine resources should ultimately be assessed by their potential impact, or ability to make a difference to ecological and social outcomes. While community-based and systematic approaches to establishing marine protected areas have their strengths and weaknesses, comparisons of their effectiveness often fail to explicitly address potential impact. Here, we predict conservation impact to compare recently implemented community-based marine reserves in Tonga to a systematic configuration specifically aimed at maximizing impact. Boosted regression tree outputs indicated that fishing pressure accounted for Ã¢Ë†Â¼24% of variation in target species biomass. We estimate that the community-based approach provides 84% of the recovery potential of the configuration with the greatest potential impact. This high potential impact results from community-based reserves being located close to villages, where fishing pressure is greatest. These results provide strong support for community-based marine management, with short-term benefits likely to accrue even where there is little scope for systematic reserve design.

Fishery community perceptions are significant in determining attitudes towards improving mangrove conditions, which can also be addressed through restoration activities. This research was conducted to analyze fisheries communities perceptions, willingness to pay (WTP) for mangroves restoration, and mangrove forest management strategies. Field surveys were conducted from July-August 2019 and February-March 2020. Primary data were collected from respondents in four regions (Kalianda Regency, South Lampung Regency, Bandar Lampung City, and Pesawaran Regency) in Lampung Province, Indonesia, which consist of fishers, shrimp farmers, crab and wood seekers, and finfish farmers. The respondents were 193 people, and four experts were involved in the policy scenario analysis.

However, scientific research was restricted for decades by the occupation of Isla MarÃƒÂ­a Madre by the Federal Penitentiary Colony of Mexico from 1905 to 2019. Aside from a list of coastal fish species published in 2011, little has been published about the fish biodiversity in the area. While the limited access to the archipelago may have acted as a de-facto marine reserve, there is evidence that fishing continued both legally for the benefit of the colony and illegally by trespassing vessels. In order to establish baseline ecological data for future conservation planning, we used baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys at all 4 islands during 3 expeditions to the archipelago in 2018. A total of 131 BRUV surveys representing ~150 h of footage were analyzed to create the most current compilation of species and abundance data on coastal marine fishes at Islas MarÃƒÂ­as. Ninety-nine species were identified, 3 of which were additions to the previous assessment. We found strong separation of fish communities based on both habitat and depth, and an association between hard-bottom habitats and high biodiversity of reef fishes. With the declaration of Islas MarÃƒÂ­as as a natural reserve and relocation of the prison in 2019, there is an opportunity for the reserve to become a priority area for marine conservation on the Pacific coast of Mexico.

177,Ecological Value of Submerged Breakwaters for Habitat Enhancement on a Residential Scale,"Estuarine shorelines have been degraded since humans arrived in the coastal zone. In recent history, a major cause of habitat degradation has been the armoring of shorelines with vertical walls to protect property from erosive wave energy; however, a lack of practical alternatives that maintain or enhance ecological function has limited the options of waterfront residents and coastal zone managers. We experimentally investigated the habitat value of two configurations of submerged breakwaters constructed along an eroding shoreline in northwest Mobile Bay, AL (USA). Breakwaters comprised of bagged oyster shell or Reef BallÃ¢â€žÂ¢ concrete domes were built by a community-based restoration effort. Post-deployment monitoring found that: bagged oyster breakwaters supported much higher densities of live ribbed mussels than Reef Ball breakwaters; both breakwater configurationsÃ‚Â supported increased species richness of juvenile and smaller fishes compared to controls; and that larger fishes did not appear to be affected by breakwater presence. Our study demonstrates that ecologically degraded shorelines can be augmented with small-scale breakwaters at reasonable cost and that these complex structures can serve as habitat for filter-feeding bivalves, mobile invertebrates, and young fishes. Understanding the degree to which these structures mitigate erosive wave energy and protect uplands will require a longer time frame than our 2-year-long study.

178,Navigating the evolution of marine policy in Panama: Current policies and community responses in the Pearl Islands and Bocas del Toro Archipelagos of Panama,"Recent changes in marine policy in Panama are closely related to sustained expansion of the Panamanian economy in the past ten years. Important drivers of economic growth such as the Panama Canal expansion, tourism, and real estate development directly involve marine and coastal areas. Therefore, maintaining the quality of these environments, as well as the sustainability of the human communities that depend on them, calls for the implementation of adequate management and planning policies. In light of a complex history of marine and coastal policy in Panama, current institutional restructuring processes, and a growing recognition of the importance of marine and coastal geographies, the authors aim to document the current status of, and community response to, marine and coastal policy in Panama, analyzed in terms of three important cross-cutting sectors: tourism, fishing, and conservation. To do so, the authors introduce two case studies: one in the Pearl Islands Archipelago and one in Bocas del Toro, each with varying degrees of participation or involvement in each sector, to illustrate the range of adaptations to change occurring in coastal communities. Based on an in-depth policy analysis and the case studies, the authors suggest that there are important administrative and structural gaps in the legislation and institutions that enforce them, as well as a lack of integration across institutions. In particular, the authors highlight the lack of clear marine and coastal property regimes as an obstacle to the implementation of integrative marine policies in Panama.

More recently, this observational evidence has been complemented by insights from economic experiments. Here we advance a third approach in which the role of local deliberation about the management of a fishery resource is investigated in a field experiment. Using three control and three treatment communities in a freshwater fishery, we tested whether participation in developing specific measures for community-based sustainable CPR management increased the willingness to contribute to the implementation of these measures. Each community was also exposed to information about their community leaders' advice about the proposed measures. Both participation and leader advice affected the willingness of participants to contribute in one of three proposed measures. However, the strongest influence on individual willingness to contribute was exerted by the individual beliefs about the cooperation of others in CPR management. Ã‚Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

181,"Hurricane 07B in the Godivari Delta, Andhra Pradesh, India: Vulnerability, mitigation and the spatial impact","Few hurricane impact studies provide robust spatial parameters of damage or relate geographical patterns of destruction accurately to storm trajectories or agencies. A detailed spatial analysis is, therefore, presented of the destruction caused by tropical hurricane 07B which made landfall on 6/7 November 1996 over the Godavari Delta region, Andhra Pradesh, eastern India. Patterns of destruction by storm surge, wind and flood water are quantitatively mapped for death tolls, house destruction and agricultural damage using local administrative (mandal) data bases. Results show that most impact occurred near the coast, but a well-defined path of destruction across the central part of the delta can be identified. Such mapping studies fail to indicate the types of individuals and social groups most affected by the storm hazard and their response to it. An investigation of landowning farmers, female migrant rural labourers and fishing communities in the delta shows that poverty and social ordering in Indian society puts differential limits on the risk reduction abilities of individuals and social groups in the face of the cyclone hazard. The paper also demonstrates that 'top down' institutional measures to reduce the effects of storm damage such as those introduced in the aftermath of hurricane 07B, including early storm warning and evacuation procedures and rehabilitation programmes, remain largely ineffective. It is suggested that the introduction of more 'bottom up' community-based programmes which seek to improve the risk awareness and risk avoiding abilities of affected individuals and groups would be much more beneficial. The case material on hurricane 07B and its effects are placed in context by reviewing and updating long and medium-term time series records of storm frequencies and impacts in the Bay of Bengal and particularly along the eastern coastline of India.",NA,No,"The paper's case study is based in India, not in any of the countries specified in the screening criteria."," No; The paper is focused on a case study in Andhra Pradesh, India, not any of the listed countries.

When those industries are scattered in a wider area, decentralised systems are also not effective in solving the problem. This paper presents the results of a community-based project that was implemented to demonstrate how wastewater problem of scattered small industries can be addressed. The paper presents the application of 'constructed wetland' technology to treat wastewater discharged by home-based industries specialised in fermented fish production.

183,Contextualising the coupled socio-ecological conditions of marine megafauna bycatch,"We apply an integrated and interdisciplinary conceptual framework to assess the potential for uptake of bycatch reduction measures by small-scale fisheries along the Andaman coast and eastern Gulf of Thailand, and in Sabah, Malaysia. Specifically, we characterize the current governance, socio-economic, ecological, and scientific context for marine megafauna bycatch, and identify the enabling and limiting factors to bycatch reduction at each location. Enabling factors are those that motivate or facilitate conservation actions among resource users, managers, and other stakeholders, while limiting factors are those that act as barriers to conservation. We conduct a comparative analysis of the strength of enabling and limiting factors at the two study locations by using a qualitative scoring system. Overall, conditions in Thailand appear to be relatively more supportive of bycatch reduction than Sabah. Many enabling factors, such as community based marine management and positive attitudes towards conservation, occur at the local scale, suggesting potential marine megafauna bycatch reduction approaches can be implemented successfully from the bottom-up. We show that intervention points for reducing marine megafauna bycatch lie within a much broader realm than conventionally considered in bycatch reduction schemes. Effective policies for reducing marine megafauna bycatch thus have to address multifaceted drivers of small-scale fishing behaviour in addition to ecological considerations.

184,Not just a fisherman's wife: Women's contribution to health and wellbeing in commercial fishing,"Objective: To explore the role of women in fishing industry organisations and communities in promoting best-practice health behaviours among fishers in Australia. Design: This paper reports aspects of research that examined how the fishing industry can best support physical health and mental well-being of fishers. The study employed a mixed-methods, multisite case study approach. Data were gathered from face-to-face and phone interactions. Setting: Two sites in Victoria and one in Western Australia. Participants: Thirty-one male fishers, including commercial licence owners, skippers, deckhands, three female family members, three fishing association representatives, one local government representative, two health care providers, and three regional health planning and funding bodies. Interventions: Not applicable. Main outcome measures: Not applicable. Results: Often unrecognised, women associated with the fishing industry are integral to the promotion of good health for fishers. They are key to identifying health issues (particularly mental health issues) and proposing community-based health and well-being strategies. They often do so by incorporating health information and activities into 'soft entry points' - informal, non-health service mechanisms by which fishers can access health information and health services. Conclusions: While not working at the industry coalface, women have a stake, and are key players, in the commercial fishing industry. Their knowledge of, and credibility within, fishing enterprises makes them valuable sources of information about health issues facing the industry and effective strategies to address them. This expertise should be applied in conjunction with industry associations and health providers to achieve better health outcomes for fishers and their families.

185,A framework of lessons learned from community-based marine reserves and its effectiveness in guiding a new coastal management initiative in the Philippines,"Community-based coastal resource management has been widely applied within the Philippines. However, small-scale community-based reserves are often inefficient owing to management inadequacies arising because of a lack of local support or enforcement or poor design. Because there are many potential pitfalls during the establishment of even small community-based reserves, it is important for coastal managers, communities, and facilitating institutions to have access to a summary of the key factors for success. Reviewing relevant literature, we present a framework of ""lessons learned"" during the establishment of protected areas, mainly in the Philippines. The framework contains summary guidance on the importance of (1) an island location, (2) small community population size, (3) minimal effect of land-based development, (4) application of a bottom-up approach, (5) an external facilitating institution, (6) acquisition of title, (7) use of a scientific information database, (8) stakeholder involvement, (9) the establishment of legislation, (10) community empowerment, (11) alternative livelihood schemes, (12) surveillance, (13) tangible management results, (14) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and (15) small-scale project expansion. These framework components guided the establishment of a community-based protected area at Danjugan Island, Negros Occidental, Philippines. This case study showed that the framework was a useful guide that led to establishing and implementing a community-based marine reserve. Evaluation of the reserve using standard criteria developed for the Philippines shows that the Danjugan Island protected area can be considered successful and sustainable. At Danjugan Island, all of the lessons synthesized in the framework were important and should be considered elsewhere, even for relatively small projects. As shown in previous projects in the Philippines, local involvement and stewardship of the protected area appeared particularly important for its successful implementation. The involvement of external organizations also seemed to have a key role in the success of the Danjugan Island project by guiding local decision-makers in the sociobiological principles of establishing protected areas. However, the relative importance of each component of the framework will vary between coastal management initiatives both within the Philippines and across the wider Asian region.

186,Challenges and Opportunities for 'little brothers' in the tourism sector matrix: The case of local communities around Great Zimbabwe National Monument,"Pro-poor tourism seeks to improve opportunities and earnings of the socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This research explored ways in which poor and often marginalized local communities around the Great Zimbabwe National Monument can benefit through pro-poor tourism. The study adopted a mixed methods research framework. Research methods included key informant interviews, a questionnaire survey, participant observations and desktop research. The research findings indicate that local communities are deriving economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits from the tourism economic sub-sector. The benefits accruing to these local communities are derived from selling artefacts, handicrafts, agricultural produce and fruits to tourists as well as often lowly paid wage employment in hotels and lodges. There are also spill-over benefits as improved transport and communication services as the area is linked by an all-weather tarred road from Masvingo City and partial cellular network provision respectively. Moreover, some of the villagers are also involved in fishing in Lake Mutirikwi and its feeder rivers. However, accrual of the stated benefits remains unsatisfactory due to a plethora of factors including poor participation by the local villagers in community-based tourism projects as a result of lack of entrepreneurial skills, technical knowhow, capital and linkages to the mainstream tourism market. The study recommends a multistakeholder approach in building the capacity of local communities in terms of tourism product development and linkages with the mainstream tourism market. This maximization of benefits will enable the local villagers to play a stewardship role towards cultural and biophysical resources found in their area thereby contributing to employment and sustainable tourism development.

188,Models of care for orphaned and separated children and upholding children's rights: Cross-sectional evidence from western Kenya,"Background: Sub-Saharan Africa is home to approximately 55 million orphaned children. The growing orphan crisis has overwhelmed many communities and has weakened the ability of extended families to meet traditional care-taking expectations. Other models of care and support have emerged in sub-Saharan Africa to address the growing orphan crisis, yet there is a lack of information on these models available in the literature. We applied a human rights framework using the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to understand what extent children's basic human rights were being upheld in institutional vs. community- or family-based care settings in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. Methods. The Orphaned and Separated Children's Assessments Related to their Health and Well-Being Project is a 5-year cohort of orphaned children and adolescents aged Ã¢â€°Â¤18 year. This descriptive analysis was restricted to baseline data. Chi-Square test was used to test for associations between categorical /dichotomous variables. Fisher's exact test was also used if some cells had expected value of less than 5. Results: Included in this analysis are data from 300 households, 19 Charitable Children's Institutions (CCIs) and 7 community-based organizations. In total, 2871 children were enrolled and had baseline assessments done: 1390 in CCI's and 1481 living in households in the community. We identified and described four broad models of care for orphaned and separated children, including: institutional care (sub-classified as 'Pure CCI' for those only providing residential care, 'CCI-Plus' for those providing both residential care and community-based supports to orphaned children, and 'CCI-Shelter' which are rescue, detention, or other short-term residential support), family-based care, community-based care and self-care. Children in institutional care (95%) were significantly (p < 0.0001) more likely to have their basic material needs met in comparison to those in family-based care (17%) and institutions were better able to provide an adequate standard of living. Conclusions: Each model of care we identified has strengths and weaknesses. The orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa requires a diversity of care environments in order to meet the needs of children and uphold their rights. Family-based care plays an essential role; however, households require increased support to adequately care for children.

189,Why human rights matter for marine conservation,"Human rights matter for marine conservation because people and nature are inextricably linked. A thriving planet cannot be one that contains widespread human suffering or stifles human potential; and a thriving humanity cannot exist on a dying planet. While the field of marine conservation is increasingly considering human well-being, it retains a legacy in some places of protectionism, colonialism, and fortress conservation. Here, we i) provide an overview of human rights principles and how they relate to marine conservation, ii) document cases where tensions have occurred between marine conservation goals and human rights, iii) review the legal and ethical obligations, and practical benefits, for marine conservation to support human rights, and iv) provide practical guidance on integrating human rights principles into marine conservation. We argue that adopting a human rights-based approach to marine conservation, that is integrating equity as a rights-based condition rather than a charitable principle, will not only help meet legal and ethical obligations to respect, protect, and fulfil human rights, but will also result in greater and more enduring conservation impact.

190,Development and perspectives for community-based management of the goose barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) fisheries in Galicia (NW Spain),"The goose barnacle, Pollicipes pollicipes, is an intertidal cirripede that lives attached to rocks on very exposed shores, forming dense aggregations. It occurs in the northeast Atlantic (from 48 to 14Ã‚Â°N). Commercial fisheries have been developed in several countries, but except for a short-lived local consumption, most of the production is traded in the Spanish market, where the price can reach ?80/kg in first-sale auctions. This species shows a strong spatial structure, constituting metapopulations with local adult populations sharing a common larval pool. Advection of larvae depends largely of oceanographic conditions that govern larval transport and survival. In Galicia (NW Spain), the regional government regulations promote a co-management system between fishers' organisations (""cofradÃƒÂ­as"") and the fisheries authority through territorial user rights for fishing (TURFs). Since 1992, the exploitation is granted to ""cofradÃƒÂ­as"" after presentation of an annual plan of exploitation and management, where fishing (daily allocation of effort, maximum individual quotas and area of exploitation), surveillance and the commercialisation processes are established. The recent implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) designed for the management of Pollicipes in Galicia will allow for new ways to improve the elaboration and control of management plans by fishers' organisations using a combination of the available statistical data and computer-based methods. The system, including databases and software for the visualisation of geographic information, was designed for independent use in each ""cofradÃƒÂ­ a"" or in a network, and its results are accessible in a web site (http://sigremar.cesga.es).

191,3 The gulf of guinea large marine ecosystem project: Turning challenges into achievements,"Between 1995 and 1999, six countries in the Gulf of Guinea, a subset of the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem which covers 16 countries between Guinea Bissau and Angola, cooperated in a Global Environment Facility funded pilot project. The project focussed on reversing the degradation of the coastal and marine environment and ensuring long term sustainable utilisation of the region's ample but shared living resources. It was based on an ecosystem approach to management, implicit in the innovative Large Marine Ecosystem programmes described by Sherman and Anderson (this volume). Besides those actions focussed on reducing pollution from land based activities especially from industries, achievements included a sustained survey of the productivity of the ecosystem using ships of opportunity, a successful joint region-wide fish trawl survey, community based mangrove restoration efforts and the formulation of National Integrated Coastal Areas Management Plans based on common regional policies and strategies. The capacity to intervene meaningfully in the protection of the environment and more so in taking preventive measures was enhanced, and definitive steps were taken towards the institutionalisation of GIS based decision making support systems. A Ministerial level ""Accra Declaration"" was adopted in 1998 by Environment Ministers from the six countries embodying political, intellectual and material commitments to environmentally sustainable development of the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem.

192,Governing offshore fish aggregating devices in the Eastern Caribbean: Exploring trade-offs using a qualitative network model,"The use of moored Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in small-scale fisheries is a potential solution to food security concerns, economic development needs, and the overexploitation of nearshore coastal fisheries in the Eastern Caribbean. However, moored FADs also generate novel and largely unstudied governance challenges involving (1) the provisioning of FADs, (2) fisheries resource appropriation, (3) human wellbeing, and (4) food web impacts. We examine the relative performance of three governance scenarios to address these challenges: private-individual, community-based, and top-down governance. We construct a qualitative network model (QNM) of the fishery based on semi-structured interviews (n = 60) with fishers and fisheries managers, established food web and economic models, and expert knowledge. We simulate the social-ecological impacts of the three governance scenarios. The models suggest that community-based and top-down governance scenarios result in low levels of conflict, but provide limited incentives to develop and maintain moored FADs. The private-individual governance scenario tends to increase conflict and incentives for monitoring FADs, but has no impact on incentives for maintaining and deploying FADs.

This research describes the development and testing of a framework of engagement to guide collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians during an environmental sciences research project. That project aimed to assess trepang (sea cucumber) stocks in Aboriginal waters, and determine the commercial harvest potential of the resource to local people. Its objectives were to undertake trepang survey and mapping, integrate Indigenous knowledge about the resource, and model the existing catch data of commercial fishers operating in the region. The framework of engagement developed to guide the research process comprised a goal, research stages, and a number of guiding principles for collaboration, which were constructed from content analysis of available guidelines and literature and from data gathered during expert interviews. Further data were gathered using participant observation, while implementing the trepang research in accordance with this framework of engagement, and these data were analysed to test and evaluate the framework.

Seasonal aggregations of whale sharks in shallow coastal waters of many countries have led to the development of ecotourism industries. Whale sharks that aggregate seasonally at Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia have a migration range within Indonesian and Southeast Asian waters. However, very little is known about their behaviour, local migration patterns, or potential threats faced in this region. In this study, we investigated traditional ecological knowledge of whale sharks through interviews with Bajo and other fishers from five settlements in the Timor and Roti Islands in eastern Indonesia. We found that there are culturally driven prohibitions and customary beliefs concerning whale sharks among Bajo fishermen, who commonly sight sharks in the Timor Sea, in southern Indonesian and Timor Leste waters. Sightings are most common during the months of August to December. Interviews also indicate a low level of harvesting of whale sharks in the region. The results demonstrate the potential for combining traditional ecological knowledge and new technology to develop whale shark management strategies, and to determine the predictability of whale shark appearances as one vital factor in assessing the potential for development of small-scale whale shark ecotourism initiatives.

198,Legislating community-based management: Lessons from the Venezuelan freshwater fishery,"The linkage between legitimate local participation and institutional/legal openness was demonstrated by an evaluation of the current freshwater fishery regulatory system in Venezuela as explicated in the 1944 Ley de Pesca (Law of the Fishery). By examining the current efficacy of Venezuela's freshwater fishery laws and government openness to local input, this case-study illustrates barriers to community-based management (CBM) created by top-down management paradigms and hierarchical legal frameworks. Analysis of a proposed CBM project in Venezuela indicates that enabling institutions and legislation are necessary for effective long-term, decentralized freshwater fishery management. Social learning is considered as an approach for making the political and legal climate more amenable to local input. The intent is to further clarify how the union of what is legal and what is civil in a society can enhance the capacity and potential of management devolution and therefore bring us closer to achieving sustainable natural resource use.",NA,No,"The case study is from Venezuela, not from any of the countries listed in the SC."," No; The abstract and title clearly indicate that the case study is based in Venezuela, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

199,"Attitudes and perceptions of villagers toward community-based mariculture in Minahasa, North Sulawesi, Indonesia","This study assesses how characteristics of individuals (e.g. preparedness to take risks), households (e.g. employment structure) and communities (e.g. distribution of resources) affect the chances that mariculture is successfully adopted as an alternative to fisheries. An increasing number of coastal households in tropical countries see their livelihoods endangered by declining fisheries catches. Acceptable livelihood alternatives are needed to reduce the pressure on the marine environment. Indonesian coastal communities do not always depend exclusively on fishing but often diversify their livelihood portfolios, which makes livelihood programs a relevant policy intervention for them. Sea cucumber mariculture is increasingly advocated in Indonesian coastal management. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and non-participant observation, current livelihoods and the attitudes toward the possibility of sea cucumber mariculture activities were assessed in two coastal villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Respondents stated a high interest in alternative livelihoods. At the same time, non-economic factors such as tradition and personal gratification played an important role in decisions on whether to fish or not. Villagers' attitudes were influenced by fishery-related experiences, perceptions and understandings, as well as by previous experiences with alternative livelihood programs. The results suggest that it is easier to turn people with farming experience into aquaculturists than people who are highly focused on fishing. Moreover, the indications are that sea cucumber mariculture would remain an additional source of income rather than replace fishing. In the study area, mariculture is still an unfamiliar activity, not yet sufficiently trusted to generate willingness to invest. Villagers' general acceptance of non-fishing income alternatives will need to be promoted if livelihood alternatives are to be successful in reducing pressure on marine resources.

200,Investigating the causes of fish community change in the Dahan River (Taiwan) using an autecology matrix,"Recent work in river restoration and water resources management has seen the need to change the focus of analysis from reach to watershed scales to better define causes of watershed impairment. However, comprehensive investigations at a watershed scale are hindered by difficulties in using reach data that was collected for analysis at small spatial and short temporal scales. This is especially true for ecological and biological data. The approach assembles assessment and monitoring data and uses an autecology matrix to identify the changes in environmental and ecological conditions that may be associated with community change over spatial and temporal scales appropriate for ecosystem analysis in watersheds. The analysis uses a weight-of-evidence approach based on the percent of the community associated with a matrix factor. We have used the autecology matrix to examine historical fish community data from the Dahan River, Taiwan. The results show that the method provides an improved understanding of historical influences on fish community structure and supports a process-based analysis of community change over watershed scales and historic time periods. Further the method helps identify habitat requirements for the fish communities at each sampling site, supporting management and ecological restoration objectives.

201,Co-management of coral reef fisheries: A critical evaluation of the literature,"In many parts of the world, inshore marine resources are being increasingly managed through collaborative arrangements between communities, governments, civil society and other groups. However, co-management of fisheries has had a mixture of successes and failures. Theorists and applied researchers have suggested a series of preconditions or factors thought to improve the chances of successful common-pool resource management. These include common property institutional design principles and their contextual conditions. Using a variety of web-based English keyword searches, published literature on community-based management and co-management of coral reefs was systematically reviewed with the view of determining if and how studies were evaluating these management systems as well as the extent to which critical aspects of common property theory were investigated and tested. Based on a screening of 600 and full evaluation of 157 journal articles, four measures of ecological conditions and five measures of contextual condition improvement were examined or could be evaluated with the data presented in 38 papers, which examined 49 co-management projects. Fewer than half of the 49 studies met the inclusion criteria of the analyses for documenting key design principles or contextual conditions. Additionally, most projects did not systematically report on contextual conditions, common property design principles and measures of success. The analysis demonstrates the large theoretical and empirical gaps in the evaluation of these management systems and begs for a more scientific, critical and multivariate approach.

202,Evaluating characteristics of community riparian awareness program interactions,"As part of its mandate to evaluate and monitor program delivery, the Alberta Riparian Habitat Management Society (Cows and Fish) has commissioned independent evaluations to examine the effectiveness and applicability of the community-based riparian awareness and management program. The society's aim is to improve the understanding of landscape function, to better enable landowners and managers to make management decisions. The staff interaction evaluation examined staff ability to deliver certain valued characteristics, and identified whether the program and staff increased awareness and management action. Respondents rated staff highly on all characteristics. Landowners that participated in riparian health programming as part of community/watershed groups were 19% more likely to have learned new information and 21% more likely to implement management change than those that were not part of a group. Repeat interactions are critical to learning new information and influencing management. All those with frequent interactions had learned new information, compared to only 70% of those with very little interaction. A diverse array of interactions led respondents to alter their management, indicating the need for a wide variety of extension tools and activities. The results strongly support the need for a community-based approach in resource management and awareness activities, which enables repeat. ongoing and diverse interactions with extension staff.

203,Action research as systems change,"For those of us interested in using research as a tool for social change, action research is a valuable, if not necessary tool in our methodological tool belt. Action research (AR) involves a collaborative process between the researcher and members of a targeted community (e.g., organization, neighborhood, small city) where both the insiders (community members) and outsiders (researchers) co-generate meaning, mutually design actions, and jointly assess the impact of these interventions. Of course, many other community-based research methods include such a collaborative process (e.g., community-based participatory research, joint insider-outsider research). What sets action research apart from this collective set of democratized research processes is AR's explicit focus on action. Knowledge is generated for the purpose of action. The need for action is what unites the researcher and the community: The need to resolve some presenting problem or underlying condition is what frames the cycle of inquiry and the purpose for the project. To date, AR has been used to address a variety of organizational, interorganizational, and community concerns including improving interorganizational operations (Adler, Shani, & Styhre, 2004; Coghlan & Brannick, 2001), promoting community development (Minkler, 2000), expanding health care services (Bellman, 2003; Bellman, Bywood, & Dale, 2003; Stringer & Genat, 2004), guiding education and curriculum changes (Meyers & Rust, 2003; Mills, 2003; Sagor, 2000), and enhancing local government (Bell, 2008). Given this context, it should not be surprising that action research fi ts well with the values and objectives of an engagement agenda. Both the engagement movement and action research insist upon an active collaboration between faculty and partnering communities; both require dialogue as a means for identifying shared goals and shared methodologies for resolving selected problems; both necessitate processes for eliciting and supporting local expertise to bear upon local problems and local solutions (Fear, Rosaen, Bawden, & Foster- Fishman, 2006). Most importantly of all, both the scholarship of engagement and action research are approaches dedicated to the production of practical knowledge-knowledge that aims to contribute to the greater social good and foster human fl ourishing because it helps make decisions to improve conditions in society (Heron & Reason, 1997). The purpose of this chapter is to discuss how engaged faculty members can use action research to promote social change. This paper also considers how AR can become even more effective at promoting social change when researchers and community partners adopt a systems orientation. By taking such a systems change approach, AR researchers and community participants are far more likely to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and design actions that are more likely to lead to transformative change. We fi rst describe AR, discuss the diversity of approaches an AR research can adopt, and then discuss how a systems change orientation can be applied in an AR project when transformative change is desired. We use several case studies throughout this chapter to illustrate the different stages of an AR project and the multiple approaches that are available to an AR researcher.

204,Evaluating tools for the spatial management of fisheries,"The ability to define the spatial dynamics of fish stocks is critical to fisheries management. Combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the regulation of area-based management through physical patrols and port side controls are growing areas of management attention. Augmenting the existing approaches to fisheries management with forensic techniques has the potential to increase compliance and enforcement success rates. We tested the accuracy of three techniques (genotyping, otolith microchemistry and morphometrics) that can be used to identify geographic origin. We used fish caught from three fishing grounds, separated by a minimum of 5Ã‚Â km and a maximum of 60Ã‚Â km, to test the accuracy of these approaches at relatively small spatial scales. Using nearest-neighbour analyses, morphometric analysis was the most accurate (79.5%) in assigning individual fish to their fishing ground of origin. Neither otolith microchemistry (54.0%) or genetic analyses (52.4%) had sufficient accuracy at the spatial scales we examined. Synthesis and applications. The combination of accuracy and minimal resource requirements make morphometric analysis a promising tool for assessing compliance with area-based fishing restrictions at the scale of kilometres. Furthermore, this approach has promising application, in small-scale fisheries through to community-based management approaches where technical and financial resources are limited.

205,The role of MSC certification in the empowerment of fishing cooperatives in Mexico: The case of red rock lobster co-managed fishery,"We describe the certification of the red rock lobster fishery of Mexico and the resulting empowerment of the fishing cooperatives. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification program recognizes sustainable fishing; the Mexican lobster is the first community-based fishery to be certified. Lobster is harvested by fishermen cooperatives that have limited access rights, organizational incentives, self-management ability, and investment in fixed and social capital. The lobster fishery represents effective co-management by government and cooperatives and MSC certification that leads to non-economic benefits, especially empowerment and community strengthening. MSC certification has had a positive impact on fishermen's cooperatives and gained international recognition for the Mexican fishery policy, with the possibility of increased renewal of fishermen's access rights. We argue that co-management and community-based decision-making addresses the issue of fish sustainability. The benefits of MSC certification could not be repeated in other fisheries in Mexico, where fishermen do not share strong management and community identity.

This article analyzes decentralized coastal zone management in two neighboring countries, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Federal system in Malaysia is argued to be able to influence more decentralized coastal zone management and to promote community-based management approaches. Meanwhile, the large diversity of coastal resources and communities combined with a still as yet tested decentralization policy in Indonesia is argued to bring more challenges in implementing the decentralization and community-based approaches in coastal zones. The lessons learned in this study provide insight in how far decentralized coastal zone management has taken place in Malaysia and Indonesia. The significant differences in the pattern of coastal zone management in these two countries are discussed in detail.

The exploitation rates (E) of A. occidentalis and H. fasciatus were 0.7 and 0.6, which exceeded the optimization (Eopt) criterion of 0.5 for sustainable exploitation of fisheries, indicating that these species were over exploited.

208,Marine protected area networks in the Philippines: Trends and challenges for establishment and governance,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are the most extensively implemented fisheries management and conservation tool in the Philippines. Most MPAs have been established and managed by communities together with local governments in a variety of community-based and co-management schemes. This approach has proven successful in gaining community acceptance and achieving local-scale fisheries and conservation objectives. However, the contribution of these MPAs to ecologically connected networks of MPAs is variable since most MPAs were not designed to be parts of networks. Nevertheless, there is growing support for the development of MPAs within the national integrated coastal management framework which supports the "" scaling up"" of MPAs to establish networks. Scaling up in the Philippine context is achieved by forging inter-institutional collaboration among neighboring local governments (i.e. village to provincial level), with the assistance of other institutions such as non-government organizations, academe, government agencies, and development partners including donors. Herein we review the history of MPAs in the Philippines and the development of inter-institutional collaborations and present examples of scaling up of MPAs to form networks. To further the establishment of social and ecological MPA networks in the Philippines, we describe approaches to forming MPA networks and discuss the fundamental elements of successful collaborative partnerships.

209,Attitudes and behaviors toward Amazon River dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) in a sustainable use protected area,"Negative interactions between fishers and the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), or boto, have increased substantially in the last few decades. Herein, we investigate these interactions with focus on assessing fisher perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward botos. Moreover, we evaluate the effect that the MamirauÃƒÂ¡ Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR) in the Brazilian Amazon, and related programs, has had on fisher attitudes and behaviors toward botos. The results suggest that interactions between fishers and botos, such as depredation and incidental entanglement, are frequent, and that the illegal harvest for botos, for use as bait, occurs in the majority of the study communities. However, the assessment revealed that most fishers have positive attitudes toward botos and that these attitudes have been influenced by participation in the MSDR activities such as research and ecotourism. Our results also highlight the importance of community-based enforcement in addressing the issue of boto harvesting. The MSDR programs have successfully promoted positive attitudes toward botos and have likely played a role in limiting boto mortality through behavioral controls, though the scope of influence of these programs has been restricted to a small geographical area. The current extent of these programs is insufficient to prevent the decline of the boto population; therefore, we suggest the MSDR model be used to improve and expand boto conservation efforts with communities in the region.

In North Rupununi, Guyana, the state of exploited stocks is poorly understood, and fishery monitoring and assessment are challenging because diverse fishing gears and target species are distributed across a heterogeneous landscape. This complexity created an opportunity for community-based monitoring (CBM) to support data-limited assessment. Standardised CBM was established for the North Rupununi as part of a new inland fisheries management plan initiated by indigenous community groups with support from the government. Quantitative length-based assessments undertaken for target stocks suggested moderate levels of exploitation consistent with local perception. Our study highlights that local experts and community participants with different levels of training can collect accurate biodiversity data. Further development of CBM is important in North Rupununi.

211,Mitigating cetacean bycatch in coastal Ecuador: Governance challenges for small-scale fisheries,"Bycatch of marine fauna by small-scale (artisanal) fisheries is an important anthropogenic mortality source to several species of cetaceans, including humpback whales and odontocetes, in Ecuador's marine waters. Long-term monitoring actions and varied conservation efforts have been conducted by non-governmental organizations along the Ecuadorian coast, pointing toward the need for a concerted mitigation plan and actions to hamper cetaceansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bycatch. Nevertheless, little has currently been done by the government and regional authorities to address marine mammal interactions with fisheries in eastern Pacific Ocean artisanal fisheries. This study provides a review of Ecuador's current status concerning cetacean bycatch, and explores the strengths and weaknesses of past and current programs aiming to tackle the challenges of bycatch mitigation. To bolster our appraisal of the policies, a synthesis of fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceptions of the bycatch problem is presented in concert with recommendations for fostering fishing community-based conservation practices integrated with policies to mitigate cetacean bycatch. Our appraisal, based upon the existing literature, indicates a situation of increasing urgency. Taking into consideration the fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceptions and attitudes, fisheries governance in Ecuador should draw inspiration from a truly bottom-up, participatory framework based on stakeholder engagement processes; if it is based on a top-down, regulatory approach, it is less likely to succeed. To carry out this process, a community-based conservation programs to provide conditions for empowering fishing communities is recommend.

212,"Coastal Area Management through the Eco blue Sea concept in the settlement of tribe Bajo, Torokeku Village","Coastal management is an important issue for most regions of the world. This is because the initial activities in the fisheries and marine sector began in this area, ranging from capture fisheries, aquaculture, processing of fishery products to marketing. But in reality the management of coastal areas is not optimal and evenly distributed, even though fishery and marine resources have high economic and ecological value, as happened in the coastal area of Torokeku Village.

214,Geophysical benthic habitat mapping in Lake Tanganyika (Tanzania): Implications for spatial planning of small-scale coastal protected areas,"Optimizing community-based fisheries management to enhance both food resource and biodiversity conservation in large lakes requires detailed knowledge of benthic habitats, which determines suitability for fish breeding sites. This information is unavailable for much of Lake Tanganyika, whose fisheries are threatened by a warming climate, destructive harvesting practices, and sediment pollution. Lake Tanganyika possesses a remarkably diverse fish population. Much of this is concentrated in areas with water depths less than 30 m and on rocky substrate. Here, geophysical tools were used to map benthic habitats in a 21 km2 co-management area of the lake in western Tanzania. Echosounding defined the position of the 30-m isobath, which varies with proximity to deltas and rift-related faults. Side-scan sonar discriminated among four unique substrates: crystalline bedrock, calcite-cemented sandstones, mixed siliciclastic sediments, and shell-rich sediments. Unlithified mixed silts and sands constitute over 91% of the study area. Rocky substrate composed of crystalline basement and calcite-cemented sandstone make up the less than 9% of the substrate in the study area. Crystalline bedrock was present from 0 to 30 m water depth, whereas the calcite-cemented sandstones were encountered in water less than 5 m deep. The spatial organization of rocky substrates is interpreted to be controlled by basin structure and lake level history; these habitats make ideal targets for establishing new small-scale protected areas. The techniques illustrated in this study are broadly applicable elsewhere in Lake Tanganyika, and to other large lakes where data needs for placing conservation reserves are lacking.

215,"Emerging customs: Small-scale fishing practices in Aceh, Indonesia","Off the western coast of Sumatra among the islands of Pulau Banyak, fishing is the primary occupation for the men of Haloban. They are self-described ""traditional"" fishers, using low-tech gear and small boats to catch fish, octopus, lobster, and other sealife in the nearby coral reefs and mangroves. Women also regularly venture out into the deep mud of the mangroves to collect clams. Their efforts to extract livelihoods and subsistence from the reefs take place in an open-access commons with few formal institutions or enforcement mechanisms to regulate resource use. While explicit regulations and customary limitations on fishing in the coral reef commons are lacking, Haloban fishers improvise some common etiquette and practices that are adaptable to the shifting context.This case study presents Haloban fishers' use of the commons as situated practices, unarticulated and embedded within a complex social-ecological system. These practices reflect fishers' understanding of, and relationship with, their environment, and may represent a nascent form of local ""rules-in-use"", informing behavior without direct social mechanisms for enforcement. This paper presents research collected using ethnographic methods, including participant observation at sea. As NGOs and government agencies work to craft management plans that share use of the reefs with tourism and conservation, a better understanding of actual resource use and fishing practice may inform more nuanced, adaptable, and truly ""local"" community-based management.

216,Predicting coastal fishing community characteristics in Tanzania using local monitoring data,"Small-scale marine fisheries in Tanzania provide the main source of subsistence for coastal communities, yet due to poor management, they have been overexploited for decades. These coastal fisheries have historically been described as homogeneous in gear-use and fish community makeup. Yet, regional and local variability in the characteristics of these fishing communities was recently identified with community-based fisheries-dependent data. We proposed a flexible modeling approach that incorporated local monitoring data with spatial data to predict the spatial characteristics of the marine fisheries in Tanzania. The spatial models identified relationships between fishery landings and coral reef, seagrass, and mangrove habitat patch attributes, along with fisher density and a hydrologic index. Furthermore, the predicted spatial characteristics matched previously reported fishery characteristics in both districts. The maps developed by our modeling process provide a means for stakeholders and managers to understand the spatial distribution of their fisheries and in turn, focus on explicitly managing what, how, and where fishers operate.

217,Local perceptions on social-ecological dynamics in latin america in three community-based natural resource management systems,"Several examples of community-based natural resource management in Latin American social-ecological systems exist in which communities control the management of common-pool resources. Understanding community perceptions of the performance of these systems is essential to involve communities in sustainable management strategies. In this analysis of three areas in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina, we analyzed the local perceptions of the social and environmental challenges faced by these social-ecological systems and how these challenges and drivers affect their resilience. To do this, we combined prospective structural analysis to unravel stakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceptions of each systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functioning along with network analysis to assess resilience. We identified external variables as the most influential variables in the Colombian and Argentine cases. In the Mexican case, larger influence is exerted by internal variables, particularly those linked to the governance system. The case study analysis revealed that the community-based natural resource management approach needs external support and recognition to work effectively. In the Argentine and Colombian cases, megaprojects were perceived as controllers with medium or strong influence but low dependence. The use of ancestral knowledge (Colombia), the history of land use (Mexico), and the history of the artisanal fishery (Argentina) were all perceived as common challenges to community- based natural resource management. In terms of social-ecological resilience, framed within the three-dimensional model of the adaptive cycle, all three social-ecological systems were considered to be highly connected and resilient but with different degrees of capacity or cumulative potential.

218,"A model of participatory community-based ecotourism and mangrove forest conservation in Ban Hua Thang, Thailand","This study aimed to synthesize a model of ecotourism management and mangrove forest conservation with community participation in Ban Hua Thang, Mueang District, Satun Province, Thailand. This was a mixed-methods investigation, employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The research tools were a structured interview, field survey, participant observation, and questionnaires. The study revealed that the community of Ban Hua Thang is a system of relatives, using the Muslim scripture in daily life with awareness of natural resources, conservation and culture. The process of community participation in managing mangrove forest and ecotourism comprises mutual goal setting, brainstorming on participatory management, joining actions, gaining benefits, and making assessments to achieve the goals. The model of ecotourism management and mangrove forest conservation through community participation consists of 1) a mutual goal to conserve natural resources and cultural heritage by building community pride, improving learning processes and boosting community income, 2) community-based tourism management by stakeholder administration, including structure, regulations, finance, evaluation, security, destination designation, hosttourist interaction and tourist services, 3) evaluation of feedback to stakeholders, and 4) key success factors, which rely on both internal and external supports such as the community cohesiveness, congruence of management strategy and community capital, especially the abundance of mangrove forest, cultural heritage and local fishery lifestyle. External factors include local government policy on promoting community-based tourism, the expansion of ecotourism, and tourist trends on social and environmental responsibility.

219,How effective is community-based management of freshwater resources? A review,"Despite the existence of numerous research studies on community-based conservation, relatively few focus on the particularities of freshwater ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems are distinct from terrestrial and marine ecosystems, exhibiting both greater concentrations of biodiversity and elevated threats. In addition, freshwater resources have distinct social, legal, political, and economic characteristics which limit the generalizability of community-based conservation research from other ecological domains. We examine peer-reviewed literature on community-based management of freshwater resources to understand and assess project contexts and outcomes. Our review indicates that studies of freshwater community-based management are limited in number and representativeness. While positive outcomes for both biodiversity and human well-being are commonly reported, limitations due to study design constrain the ability to infer the significance or causality of these effects. Overall, our analysis indicates that there are several gaps in the available research: across geographic regions, freshwater ecosystem types, intervention types, and environmental and human well-being outcome types. Given the importance of freshwater resources to Indigenous Peoples and local communities, our review highlights the critical need to generate evidence across more diverse contexts to achieve greater clarity on whether and how community-based projects can be most effective.

220,Coral reef conservation incentives and revenue sharing,"Coral reefs are at particular risk of overexploitation and extinction due to negative externalities from productive sectors such as tourism and fisheries. Increased reliance on tourism revenue means difficult trade-offs. This study proposes a community-based approach to conservation based on a bioeconomic model. We extend earlier work on exogenous reward-based conservation programs by specifying rewards contingent on the level of conservation effort. In addressing the questionÃ¢â‚¬â€whether effort-dependent revenue-sharing incentivizes local residents to engage in conservation activitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€the findings indicate that what matters is the relative size of reward, the degree of reliance on coral reefs as a source of revenue, and how the stock is perceived by economic agents, that is, whether they view coral reefs as a commodity or a nuisance.

221,Restoration of small lakes through cooperative management: A suitable strategy for poverty-laden areas in developing countries?,"Lake Rupa is a small, subtropical, shallow lake with a surface area of 100 ha situated 600 m a.s.l. in Central Himalaya, Nepal. This degraded lake was studied between 2000 and 2006, with the goal of determining whether or not it could be restored by a community-based cooperative of local people living in its catchment. Main threats to the lake, its aquatic life and its very existence include encroachment by excessive aquatic vegetation, sedimentation, and low in-lake concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO). Small lakes (Ã¢â€°Â¤ 500 ha) are relatively prone to the process of 'succession and climax', although they also can be of social, environmental and ecological importance. Thus, their disappearance could spark social chaos and disorder in areas already having to cope with other rapid environmental changes. This means that credible mechanisms for revitalizing or protecting small lakes are an important goal. Accordingly, a lake cooperative of 329 households living in close vicinity to Lake Rupa was formed in 2002, by prioritizing traditional fishers, women and other deprived community members with the goals of respecting the citizenry and equity. Following the cooperative's campaigns directed at weed removal and fish stocking, encroachment of vegetation on the lake margins was halted, its aquatic weeds became under control, and its fisheries improved. In addition to the cooperative's restoration activities, several water quality parameters, including water transparency and DO and chlorophyll-a concentrations, were monitored on a monthly basis. The measured water transparency was inconsistent, exhibiting large variations between 2000 and 2003. Relatively low, but consistent, values, however, were measured after 2004. The results imply that the removal of weeds, and sufficient nutrients and solar radiation are subsequently available to the lake's phytoplankton communities. Supporting this notion is that the chlorophyll-a concentration spiked to 205 ÃŽÂ¼ g L-1 in November 2006, the water transparency became consistent, and the DO concentration increased to &gt;3.8 mg L-1 during the critical months (March-May) after 2004. These water quality indicators indicated improvement in the degraded Lake Rupa, suggesting that the establishment of cooperatives such as that highlighted in this study could be a powerful and sustainable mechanism for restoring degraded lakes in similar socioeconomic settings by maintaining equity, by connecting communities with their resources, and by facilitating integrity, equity, citizenry and social justice.

222,Shuttling between land and sea: Contemporary practices among amis spearfishing men as a foundation for local marine-area management,"This paper explores how the Amis people on the east coast of Taiwan who practice freediving spearfishing manage the local marine area. Among the coastal Amis people, freediving spearfishing is not only a way of life but is also closely related to ritual ceremonies. Amis spearfishing men are knowledgeable of the near-shore sea and coast, and the practice of spearfishing collectively cultivates their ability to deal with both public affairs and human relations in the community. However, the Taiwanese government regards spearfishing guns as weapons and restricts them. Furthermore, the assumption that spearfishing destroys the coral ecosystem and fishery resources means that the practice is often demonized or increasingly restrained. In this paper, I argue that local marine Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) among Amis spearfishing men can be the foundation for local marine conservation under the concept of community-based natural-resource management (CBNRM), involving both the local Amis community and the government, in spite of both parties still having their own issues to overcome.

223,Positive Social-Ecological Feedbacks in Community-Based Conservation,"Marine area-based conservation measures including no-take zones (areas with no fishing allowed) are often designed through lengthy processes that aim to optimize for ecological and social objectives. Their (semi) permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5 years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of such fisheries closures (Ã¢â‚¬Å“fishing refugiaÃ¢â‚¬Â) in northwest Mexico to hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing as long as initial designs are ecologically Ã¢â‚¬Å“good enoughÃ¢â‚¬Â and supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the toolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.

224,Undernutrition in the isolated elderly poor: Perspectives from a developing country humanitarian program,"Elderly people living in sub-Saharan countries are at risk of undernutrition due to food insecurity, feebleness and for some, abandonment. A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted on 62 elderly men and women, aged 61-101 years, living in two isolated villages in the rural Ngara District of northwestern Tanzania. All subjects received supplemental food for 21 months prior to the survey from a local humanitarian program, The Village Angels of Tanzania (TVAT). The aim of this study was to compute the nutritional status of the participants using the anthropometric measurements of Body Mass Index (BMI), Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), and Triceps Skinfold (TSF), and to identify on-going program strategies to address their nutritional needs. SPSS version 24 and basic descriptive statistics were used to analyze all data. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) accepted ranges for adults, the BMI data showed 53% men and 70% women were in the healthy range, 40% men and 21% women were undernourished, and 7% men and 9% women were mildly overweight. The MUAC cut-off point of Ã¢â€°Â¤ 22.5 cm which corresponds to BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m 2 , the WHO cut-off reference for undernutrition, indicated 87% men and 72% women had both normal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat levels and 13% men and 28% women were undernourished. The TSF figures, also based on WHO ranges, indicated 88% men and 96% women had depleted fat stores and 12% men and 4% women had normal fat stores. Body Mass Index showed strong positive correlations with MUAC (r = 0.75, N = 62, p &lt; 0.001) and with TSF (r = 0.58, N = 62, p &lt; 0.001). The supplemental food likely played a positive role in the healthy weight status (BMI) and normal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat levels (MUAC) of the majority of participants (62%, 80% respectively) but not in their depleted fat stores status (TSF). These findings culminated in recommendations that adroitly targeted newly identified nutritional concerns. Increasing dietary variety, especially meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and increasing the quantity and nutrient density of a nutritional powder made from stoneground peanuts, soya beans, maize, and millet were two new dietary strategies immediately implemented at the conclusion of the study. Positive TSF trends would support the effectiveness of TVAT's food delivery program to improve this crucial nutritional parameter for this population. Ã‚Â© Afr. J. Food Agric. Nutr.

225,Signals of Potential Species Associations Offer Clues about Community Organisation of Stream Fish across Seasons,"Environmental filtering, spatial factors and species interactions are fundamental ecological mechanisms for community organisation, yet the role of such interactions across different environmental and spatial settings remains mostly unknown. In this study, we investigated fish community organisation scenarios and seasonal species-to-species associations potentially reflecting biotic associations along the Qiupu River (China). Based on a latent variable approach and a tree-based method, we compared the relative contribution of the abiotic environment, spatial covariates and potential species associations for variation in the community structure, and assessed whether different assembly scenarios were modulated by concomitant changes in the interaction network structure of fish communities across seasons. We found that potential species associations might have been under-estimated in community-based assessments of stream fish. Omnivore species, since they have more associations with other species, were found to be key components sustaining fish interaction networks across different stream orders. Hence, we suggest that species interactions, such as predation and competition, likely played a key role in community structure. For instance, indices accounting for network structure, such as connectance and nestedness, were strongly correlated with the unexplained residuals from our latent variable approach, thereby re-emphasising that biotic signals, potentially reflecting species interactions, may be of primary importance in determining stream fish communities across seasons. Overall, our findings indicate that interaction network structures are a powerful tool to reflect the contribution of potential species associations to community assembly. From an applied perspective, this study should encourage freshwater ecologists to empirically capture and manage biotic constraints in stream ecosystems across different geographical and environmental settings, especially in the context of the ever-increasing impacts of human-induced local extinction debts and species invasions.

Thirty-two lobster fishers and 5 individuals from fisheries management agencies were interviewed from the Bay of Fundy (BoF), Eastern Canada to determine how to mitigate risk to marine fauna from ALD fishing gear. Results show that fishers across four lobster fishing areas within the BoF regularly lost gear; gear that was often not retrieved. Although fishers informally notified each other of gear losses and sometimes returned retrieved gear to owners, they avoided retrieving old and unidentifiable gear, because possession of this gear is prohibited under their license conditions. Interviews identified specific reporting, regulatory and community-based solutions to help estimate, manage and mitigate ALD fishing gear.

227,"Fish catch during southwest monsoon season in taytay bay, northwest sulu sea, Philippines: With notes on live reef fisheries","Palawan produced 70 percent of the PhilippinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ LRFT export. The municipality wanted to maintain or save its LRF and bay fisheries, thus the objectives of this study are to gather information on the status of CPUE and LRF in Taytay Bay, and to provide recommendations to fisheries planning and management. Standard catch survey method was used to estimate CPUE of different gears. Survey was conducted every day between August and September 2009, representing the mid-Southwest Monsoon fishing season. Nine fishing gears operating in the bay were recorded. Drift gillnet has the highest effort and fish biomass landed, followed by Hookah-spear gun. Bagnet has the highest CPUE followed by Bottom gillnet, and were most efficient gears in terms of catch/fisher/hour. However, Bagnet CPUE tended to decrease through the years. Hook and line fisher composed more than half of the fisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population of the bay and was the priority livelihood. The total fishing effort would soon put pressure to the LRF resources. It will also likely create an unequal distribution of type of fishers in the bay, which will make bay fisheries unstable. The total catch in the bay per month during Southwest Monsoon period was estimated to be 337.2 t. Serranidae consisted only 5% of the total catch. Of this, 40% were Plectropomus leopardus, and the rest were composed of third class serranids and tiger groupers. Of the serranid species caught, 13% were sold alive, while the rest were sold fresh. The low catch and smaller sized live fish species indicate that LRF is under pressure and may not be viable anymore. This is alarming since so many fishermen were competing to catch the same depleting resource, which can eventually collapse if no immediate management schemes will be introduced. Highlights of recommendations are: bag net should not operate in the municipal waters, bottom gill net should be continuously promoted in the bay; status of red grouper stock/population should be monitored, and immediate regulatory management schemes must be in placed; community-based aquaculture of high demand-high priced species, with complete breeding and grow-out technology like Cromileptes altivelis must be introduced to lessen the pressure on existing LRF species; the government should find means to let fishers indulge in more diverse fisheries to have a stable fishing industry; and another survey must be conducted during the Northeast Monsoon period.

228,Chapter 16: Histories and continuities of water governance in Northern Ghana,"To counteract low water productivity in many developing countries, international donors promote community-based management. This practice was meant to replace top-down governmental approaches. In Ghana, the water sector came under review in the 1990s. Institutions have been decentralized, and management tasks transferred to communities, associations, and private-sector entities. While assigning ownership and responsibilities to communities is feasible for rural water management, the chapter shows that policy makers and practitioners tend to ignore the historical background of existing structures and antagonisms of traditional and present management systems. Implementation strategies are therefore prone to failure. The chapter analyzes the administrative history of water governance in Ghana and related problems to date. The case study on fisheries management has its setting in the Upper East Region of Ghana, where people use reservoirs to improve their livelihoods through irrigation, cattle watering, and fisheries. In the course of rehabilitation projects, rights and responsibilities of management have been handed over to user groups or associations and village committees.

However, data on pet ownership are relatively limited from rural regions, Southern Asia and low-middle-income countries. We aim to report the prevalence and associated factors for pet ownership and veterinary visits in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine significant associations between variables of interest and pet ownership (p < 0.05). Out of the 532 households, 57% currently owned a pet. The most common pet was the dog owned by 41% of the households and the cat was the second most owned by 17%. Security (69% - 152/220) was the most common role for dogs at home while it was companionship for cats (31% - 27/88) and hobby for both birds (64% - 18/28) and fish (54% - 14/26). Most dogs (54% - 118/220) had one veterinary visit within the last year. Households with >1 adult female [p = 0.02; OR = 1.61 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.36)], participants living alone [p = 0.03; OR = 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.86)] and Buddhists [p = 0.02; OR = 2.56 (95% CI 1.16 to 5.63)] were significantly associated with pet ownership.

231,Co-management policy can reduce resilience in traditionally managed marine ecosystems,"Best-practice environmental policy often suggests co-management of marine resources as a means of achieving sustainable development. Here we consider the impacts of superimposing co-management policy, in the form of territorial user rights for fishers over an existing traditional community-based natural-resource management system in Chile. We consider a broad definition of co-management that includes a spectrum of arrangements between governments and user groups described by different levels of devolution of power. We used participatory rural appraisal techniques and questionnaires to understand the mechanisms that underpin the traditional management system for the bull-kelp ""cochayuyo"" (Durvillaea antarctica). Traditional management was based on the allocation of informal access rights through a lottery system. This system was controlled by a complex web of traditional institutions that were shown to be successful in terms of equity and resilience. Using a similar approach, we analyzed the effects of superimposing a government-led co-management policy into this traditional system. Two major effects of the new policy were encountered. First, traditional institutions were weakened, which had negative effects on the levels of trust within the community and intensified conflict among users. Second, the management system's adaptive capacity was reduced, thereby jeopardizing the ecosystem's resilience. Our results suggest that the devolution of power to this kind of fisher community still has not reached the level required for fishers to legally address the local deficiencies of the Chilean co-management policy. Additionally, legal adjustments must be made to accommodate traditionally managed ecosystems that offer benefits comparable to those mandated under the formal policy. A fuller understanding of the interactions between co-management and traditional institutions can help us to identify ways to promote resilience and facilitate equal access by mitigating the potential negative effects of co-management policy and informing its future implementation.

233,Coastal habitats and their importance for the diversity of benthic communities: A species- and trait-based approach,"Coastal habitats are used by a great variety of organisms during some or all stages of their life cycle. When assessing the link between biological communities and their environment, most studies focus on environmental gradients, whereas the comparison between multiple habitats is rarely considered. Consequently, trait-based aspects of biodiversity in and between habitats have received little attention. Here, we use the biological trait approach in addition to the more common species-based approach to examine trait and taxonomic diversity and composition of invertebrate and fish communities in different coastal habitats, common in the northern Baltic Sea. The habitats include bladderwrack (Fucus), seagrass (Zostera), rock with associated algal species (Rock), and bare sand (Sand). We found distinct differences in community diversity and composition between the habitats. For invertebrates, the sediment of the seagrass meadow had the highest taxonomic and trait richness and diversity, whereas Sand had the highest for fish. The highest dissimilarity in invertebrate community composition was between epifaunal (Rock, Fucus, Zostera Epifauna) and infaunal habitats (Sand, Zostera Infauna) on the one hand, and between vegetated (Zostera Infauna) and unvegetated sediments (Sand) on the other hand, emphasizing the major role vegetation plays in structuring communities. We demonstrate that fish community composition is distinct based on species, and to a lesser degree also distinct based on traits, in the different studied habitats. Both invertebrate and fish communities were more similar on a trait level than taxonomically among the habitats highlighting the presence of similar trait identities in the different habitats. Among the traits examined, Body size contributed most to dissimilarities among habitats for both invertebrates and fish, pointing out the ecological importance of body size for differentiating trait composition of communities. Based on our assessment of biodiversity, using the biological trait approach parallel to the taxonomic approach, we show that trait-based measures clearly provide additional information, such as key functions present in a habitat. This aspect cannot be captured by solely using taxonomic indices, which only shed light on diversity from a species identity point of view.

234,Participatory planning of a community-based payments for ecosystem services initiative in Madagascar's mangroves,"Although the dynamics of coastal resources are largely determined by the impacts of human users, spatially-explicit social data are rarely systematically integrated into coastal management planning in data-poor developing states. In order to plan a community-based mangrove payments for ecosystem services initiative in southwest Madagascar, we used two participatory approaches; public participation geographic information systems and concept modelling workshops Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with 10 coastal communities to investigate the dynamics and spatial distribution of the mangrove resources they use. In each village we conducted participatory mapping of land and resource use with different livelihood groups using printed satellite images, and concept modelling workshops to develop concept models of the mangrove social-ecological system (including the identification of threats and underlying drivers, and proposals for targeted management strategies). Each community then proposed mangrove zoning consisting of strict conservation zones, sustainable use zones and restoration zones. Following validation and ground-truthing, the proposed zones and management strategies formed the basis of the zoning and management plan for the mangrove. Participatory approaches proved a simple and reliable way to gather spatial data and better understand the relationships between the mangrove and those who use it. Moreover, participation stimulated mangrove users to consider resource trends, the impacts of their activities, and required management actions, promoting a collective Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbuy-inÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for the project. Since participation extended beyond research to the development of management zones, rules and strategies, we believe that community ownership of the project has been strengthened and the chances of successfully conserving the mangrove improved.

235,Transforming the social-ecological systems framework into a knowledge exchange and deliberation tool for comanagement,"The social-ecological system framework (SESF) can be useful for applied research and management practice beyond its traditional academic applications. In this article we transform the SESF into an image-based practical tool to facilitate knowledge exchange and deliberation processes within community-based natural resource comanagement settings. We develop a transdisciplinary methodology to transform the SESF into simple and context relevant images that are understandable by nonspecialists, yet the image-based framework still conveys its core tenets of systems thinking, a checklist for system complexity and conceptualizing social-ecological interactions. We then demonstrate a mixed-method approach for testing the usefulness of the image-based framework for enhancing communication, knowledge exchange, and deliberation processes. We show how the academic uses of the SESF, its core tenets, can serve the same purpose for nonacademic actors. When transformed, the image-based SESF has potential to be a tool that can enhance communication and knowledge exchange between actors in governance settings. We demonstrate our methodology with small-scale fishers involved with comanagement in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. In the example, we show how scientists must learn from fishers, to understand how they view their system, in order to make the image-based tool useful in context. We then test its usefulness by exploring the hypothesis that the image-based framework can help fishers discuss with more depth and complexity because it provides a simple conceptual base for systems thinking and a core set of variables to consider as interacting. Furthermore, we explore how using the framework during deliberation may be able to alter the social-psychological outcomes of participants using field experimental methods. We discuss our combined methodology, for transforming the framework and measuring deliberation impacts, while reflecting on new ways of thinking about how the SESF can be useful for applied research and practice.

237,Institutions and collective action in a Costa Rican small-scale fisheries cooperative: the case of CoopeTÃƒÂ¡rcoles R.L,"CoopeTarcoles R.L is a cooperative on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica that has obtained better conditions for its members in the context of small-scale sustainable fisheries for over thirty years. Documents from the cooperative and interviews with diverse stakeholders provided information on the catalytic factors that have made CoopeTarcoles R.L advance towards small-scale fisheries sustainability. A political framework provided by the State concerned with social welfare, the adaptation of the organizational cooperative model to local needs and a community-based governance model for fishery management have been crucial in this regard. Information gathered shows that this collective enterprise has been able to create alternative and gender balanced sources of employment, lead environmental and ecosystem improvement and obtain better prices for fishery products across its three decades of existence. The cooperative, being a local, collective and inclusive initiative, has turned into an engine for community sustainable development, recognizing the value of small-scale fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ identity and its importance for the well being of the area. Several factors combined to be crucial for the long-term vision of the fishers in the cooperative and their successful path towards sustainable development. This study highlights the initial support of the government for the creation of a collective organization with adequate infrastructure, the structural changes that led to responsible fishing being promoted by the recognition of a Marine Responsible Fishing Area, and the more equitable relationships supported 15Ã‚Â years ago by another cooperative (CoopeSoliDar R.L.) dealing with human rights and marine conservation.

239,Addressing Marine Wildlife Entanglement in Derelict Fishing Nets Using Community-Based Social Marketing: Case Study and Lessons Learnt,"Background: Entanglement of marine species, particularly endangered sea turtles and cetaceans, in abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear is a major conservation concern. Focus of the Article: This case study applies Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to reduce marine wildlife net entanglement in the waters surrounding Masirah Island, a marine biodiversity hotspot in Oman. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The study demonstrates the use of social marketing tools in biodiversity conservation, bringing new knowledge to the cross-application of these two fields. Methods: The CBSM methodology was applied to select behaviours, identify barriers and benefits, develop strategies and design a pilot study. The responsible disposal of derelict nets in skip bins was selected as the target behaviour, and a mix of behavioural change tools was applied to achieve change: convenience (installation of three skip bins), education (installation of informative signs, distribution of awareness posters, one-to-one engagement with fishers on the beaches), prompts (installation of signs and posters on vessels) and social norms (one-to-one engagement with key influencers and decision makers). The monitoring of behaviour change took place through structured observations over 23 weeks, focussing on the number of nets disposed of in the allocated skip bins. Results: Results showed a low level of behaviour adoption rate by skiff and launch vessel fisheries, respectively, 5.36% and 2.58%. Positive results were observed for a short time but did not reach the estimated target value throughout the study period. Recommendations for Research: Our pilot study did not lead to broad-scale implementation and we recommend further awareness and engagement with the target audience, trials of various behaviour change tools and increase field monitoring time. We further recommend the application and funding of behaviour change methods applied to fishers with the incorporation of conventional financial, conservation and regulatory tools to support resource management. Limitations: Our results show that focussing on specific behaviours with appropriate measurement is both resource and time demanding to solve pressing conservation problems, particularly ones generated by complex industries such as fishing. Various lessons, useful for other social marketers, have been drawn from our evaluation of the overall study.

240,The effect of leadership and other contextual conditions on the ecological and socio-economic success of small-scale fisheries in Southeast Asia,"Small scale fisheries (SSF) and communities that rely on them are increasingly at risk from social and environmental pressures. Leadership is commonly thought to be a crucial contextual condition to help alleviate those pressures in a variety of SSFs globally. This paper aims to explore how SSF leadership and other important contextual conditions act, alone and in combination, to influence desired social and ecological outcomes in SSFs. Fifty case studies from Southeast Asia were analyzed using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). QCA encourages theory-informed analysis that accounts for contextuality and can identify necessary and sufficient conditions that lead to 'successful' SSF outcomes. Our results demonstrated that multiple configurations of causal conditions - pathways - led to success and failure among SSF management efforts documented in the Southeast Asian case studies. Local leadership was found to be an important determinant of ecological and social success for many case studies but the absence of a local leadership does not necessarily signal community-based fisheries management will fail. Strong local leadership could, in fact, play an important role in achieving negative outcomes in some circumstances. Effective local leadership can be supported via high level institutions and communities, through access to resources, and simply through community-oriented motivations or intentions among leaders. While the SSFs in this study were diverse and complex socio-ecological systems, regularities among potential determinants of SSF success could be identified, suggesting that key ecological and social conditions affecting both social and ecological outcomes may, in the future, be used to identify interventions to support SSF management. This study highlighted the importance of research that considers societal processes and their interactions with the environment, and of the importance of continued efforts to fully document SSF management innovations and institutions over time.

We administered an online survey from September 2018 through February 2019 to assess the collaboratives. Methods: We used a Likert scale to measure agreement on collaborative characteristics. We used Fisher exact tests to compare success ratings by health department employment and funding status. We created a radar chart to compare the percentage agreement on key characteristics of the most and least successful collaboratives. We used a general inductive approach in the qualitative analysis of open-ended question responses. Results: Of 262 survey recipients, 133 responded (51%); 49 (37%) respondents were from health departments. Most respondents (Ã¢â€°Â¥70%) agreed that their collaborative is diverse, cooperates, meets regularly, has realistic goals, has effective leadership, and has effective communication. Most respondents (87%) rated their collaborative as successful in implementing HIV prevention services for MSM and TGW of color. Comparison of the most and least successful collaborative found the greatest difference in respondent agreement in the presence of effective leadership, communication, and adequate resources. The most commonly cited challenge in the open-ended questions was inadequate resources. The most commonly cited success was increased provision of services, particularly preexposure prophylaxis.

244,"The influence of poverty and rabies knowledge on healthcare seeking behaviors and dog ownership, Cameroon","Background Rabies is a fatal encephalitis caused by lyssaviruses, with most human cases worldwide resulting from rabid dog bites. Although effective animal and human vaccines have been available for over 100 years, control efforts have not been adequately implemented on the global scale and rabies remains one of the greatest global zoonotic threats to human health. We conducted a knowledge, attitudes and practices survey in Northern Cameroon to describe dog ownership characteristics, rates of dog bites, and post-bite healthcare seeking behaviors. Methods The survey was performed in four rural Cameroonian communities. A structured community-based questionnaire was conducted over a 20-day period in April 2010, and focused on socio-economic factors correlated with gaps in rabies knowledge. Information pertaining to socio-demographics, as well as attitudes and practices with regard to animal bites and bite treatment practices were recorded. Characteristics of dog ownership such as dog confinement, resources provided to dogs, and dog vaccination status were examined. Human to dog ratios were compared on a linear scale to poverty scores by community. When applicable, 2-tailed Chi-square tests or FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact tests were calculated to determine relationships between variables. We also used One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify associations between rabies knowledge and wealth with dog ownership, dog vaccination, and human healthcare seeking behaviors. Independent variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 208 households were enrolled. Respondents were predominantly male (68.3%), with a median age of 43.6 years. Eighty-four households (39.9%) reported owning a total of 141 dogs (human dog ratio 10.4:1). The majority of dogs (61%) were allowed to roam freely. A history of rabies vaccination was reported for 30.8% of owned dogs. Respondents reported 11 bites during the two years preceding the survey (annual bite incidence was 2.6% [95% CI 1.4%Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4.6%]). Only one person (9.1%) received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and none described symptoms of clinical illness consistent with rabies. Respondents who indicated that they would seek medical care and PEP after a dog bite had higher average wealth and rabies knowledge index scores (p = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). Respondents who indicated that they would seek care from a traditional healer had significantly lower wealth scores, but not significantly different knowledge scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.49, respectively). Conclusions In the communities evaluated, the majority of dogs were allowed to roam freely and had no history of rabies vaccination; factors that favor enzootic transmission of canine rabies virus. We also identified a strong relationship between poverty and dog ownership. Bite events were relatively common among respondents, and very few victims reported utilizing health services to treat wounds. Increased wealth and knowledge were significantly associated with increased likelihood that a respondent would seek medical care and post-exposure prophylaxis. These findings indicate the need for educational outreach to raise awareness of dog rabies and proper prevention measures.

Overfishing has been the key factor driving the collapse of its populations. Therefore, conservation and management have never been more urgent. This study explores Napoleon wrasse farming in Anambas, Indonesia. Data gathering was conducted through interviews, exploring the farming practices and export trade. The findings are showing the history of overfishing of adult fish, leading to larval capture as the tragedy of the commons in the nursery grounds. Farming practices causing no stocks replenishment. The government supports the promotion of sustainable activities such as spatial protection. LMMA shows the success of community based coral reef rehabilitation, and this bring opportunity to local communities to utilize Napoleon fish other than farming. However, even though spatial protection leads to institutional arrangement to control unsustainable practices, it needs an integration with calculation based on science to determine the sustainable export quota. Unfortunately, the Non Detriment Findings on Napoleon fish trade was not based on biological assessment, so even though the recent export practice is legal, but it cannot be considered as sustainable. It is also important to allocate the benefit of the farming to broader group so the power of the dominant becomes uncentralized.

247,"Profiling the best-performing community medicine distributors for mass drug administration: A comprehensive, data-driven analysis of treatment for schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminths in Uganda","Background: The most prevalent neglected tropical diseases are treated through blanket drug distribution that is reliant on lay community medicine distributors (CMDs). Yet, treatment rates achieved by CMDs vary widely and it is not known which CMDs treat the most people. Methods: In Mayuge District, Uganda, we tracked 6779 individuals (aged 1+ years) in 1238 households across 31 villages. Routine, community-based mass drug administration (MDA) was implemented for schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminths. For each CMD, the percentage of eligible individuals treated (offered and ingested medicines) with at least one drug of praziquantel, albendazole, or ivermectin was examined. CMD attributes (more than 25) were measured, ranging from altruistic tendencies to socioeconomic characteristics to MDA-specific variables. The predictors of treatment rates achieved by CMDs were selected with least absolute shrinkage and selection operators and then analyzed in ordinary least squares regression with standard errors clustered by village. The influences of participant compliance and the ordering of drugs offered also were examined for the treatment rates achieved by CMDs. Results: Overall, only 44.89% (3043/6779) of eligible individuals were treated with at least one drug. Treatment rates varied amongst CMDs from 0% to 84.25%. Treatment rate increases were associated (p value< 0.05) with CMDs who displayed altruistic biases towards their friends (13.88%), had friends who helped with MDA (8.43%), were male (11.96%), worked as fishermen/fishmongers (14.93%), and used protected drinking water sources (13.43%). Only 0.24% (16/6779) of all eligible individuals were noncompliant by refusing to ingest all offered drugs. Distributing praziquantel first was strongly, positively correlated (p value < 0.0001) with treatment rates for albendazole and ivermectin. Conclusions: These findings profile CMDs who treat the most people during routine MDA. Criteria currently used to select CMDs - community-wide meetings, educational attainment, age, years as a CMD, etc. - were uninformative. Participant noncompliance and the provision of praziquantel before albendazole and ivermectin did not negatively impact treatment rates achieved by CMDs. Engaging CMD friend groups with MDA, selecting CMDs who practise good preventative health behaviours, and including CMDs with high-risk occupations for endemic infections may improve MDA treatment rates. Evidence-based guidelines are needed to improve the monitoring, selection, and replacement of CMDs during MDA.

249,Claims and realities of community-based water resources management: A case study of rural fisheries in Ghana,"To counteract low water productivity in many developing countries, international donors promote community-based management to replace top-down governmental approaches. In Ghana, the water sector was reviewed in the 1990s, which resulted in the decentralization of institutions and transfer of management tasks to communities, associations and private-sector entities. While assigning ownership and responsibilities to communities is feasible for rural water management, this Chapter shows that policy makers and practitioners tend to ignore the historical background of existing structures and antagonisms of traditional and present management systems. Implementation strategies are thus prone to failure. This Chapter analyses the administrative history of, and community-based participation in, water governance in Ghana from pre-colonial times to the present day. The case study on fisheries management has its setting in the Upper East Region of Ghana, where people use reservoirs to improve their livelihoods through irrigation, cattle watering and fisheries. In the course of rehabilitating projects, rights and responsibilities of management have been handed over to user groups or associations and village committees. Clashing traditional, governmental and participatory management strategies overtax communities to cope with responsibilities.

250,Adaptations to maintain the contributions of small-scale fisheries to food security in the Pacific Islands,"In several Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs), rapid population growth and inadequate management of coastal fish habitats and stocks is causing a gap to emerge between the amount of fish recommended for good nutrition and sustainable harvests from coastal fisheries. The effects of ocean warming and acidification on coral reefs, and the effects of climate change on mangrove and seagrass habitats, are expected to widen this gap. To optimise the contributions of small-scale fisheries to food security in PICTs, adaptations are needed to minimise and fill the gap. Key measures to minimise the gap include community-based approaches to: manage catchment vegetation to reduce sedimentation; maintain the structural complexity of fish habitats; allow landward migration of mangroves as sea level rises; sustain recruitment and production of demersal fish by managing Ã¢â‚¬ËœsourceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ populations; and diversify fishing methods to increase catches of species favoured by climate change. The main adaptions to help fill the gap in fish supply include: transferring some fishing effort from coral reefs to tuna and other large pelagic fish by scaling-up the use of nearshore fish aggregating devices; developing fisheries for small pelagic species; and extending the shelf life of catches by improving post-harvest methods. Modelling the effects of climate change on the distribution of yellowfin tuna, skipjack tuna, wahoo and mahi mahi, indicates that these species are likely to remain abundant enough to implement these adaptations in most PICTs until 2050. We conclude by outlining the policies needed to support the recommended adaptations.

251,Drivers and barriers to sustainable fisheries in two peri-urban impoundments in Zimbabwe,"Fisheries sustainability is categorised through four conceptual pillars: ecological, economic, and social, including cultural and institutional. Much work on fisheries sustainability has been done in marine fisheries relative to inland fisheries. Two inland peri-urban impoundments, Chivero and Manyame in Zimbabwe, support numerous small-scale fisheries; however, environmental and socioeconomic variables threaten the sustainability of the fisheries. This study aimed to identify and contextualise drivers and barriers to sustainability of small-scale fisheries in these two peri-urban impoundments. We applied three frameworks, Fishery Performance Indicators, Community-Based Fishery Indicators and FAO Small-Scale Fisheries Indicators, to identify and contextualise the drivers and barriers. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect data from fishers in the two impoundments. A structured questionnaire was administered to 115 fishers in 23 fishing companies operating in the two lakes. Fisheries income and revenue as well as food security are key drivers. Lack of postharvest equipment, volatile fish markets, water quality and quantity deterioration and fish stock decreases are key barriers to sustainability of fisheries in the two impoundments. There are subtle differences in the extent and impact of the drivers and barriers of fisheries sustainability in the two lakes. The differences relate to the uniqueness of the aquatic habitats, social constructs and fisheries operational frameworks in each lake. This suggests a need to assess fisheries sustainability using an integrated bottom-up approach starting from individual fisheries < community fisheries < global/generic fisheries.

252,Present status and approaches for the sustainable development of community based fish culture in seasonal floodplains of Bangladesh,"Coordination among the different stakeholders at policy planning, implementation and target beneficiary level, particularly among the agencies responsible for development and management of water resources, agriculture and fisheries, is essential for overall sustainable development. Stocking of larger fingerlings at suitable stocking densities of endemic (rohu, catla, mrigal) and exotic (silver carp, bighead carp, common carp/mirror carp) species should be stocked at varying proportion. Floodplain fish production depends only on the natural fertility of the water bodies. Technological interventions should include the installation of low cost bamboo fencing at water inlet and outlet points and setting of ring culverts for maintaining suitable levels of water for fish culture without hampering the production of rice and other crops in the intervention areas, selective stocking with native and exotic carps, restricted fishing for certain period of time and guarding. It is expected to exert positive influences in enhancing the standing crop and biodiversity of non-stocked species of fishes in the intervention seasonal floodplain. Entry of fish larvae, hatchlings and young fry of wild non-stocked fishes into the seasonal floodplains because of large fence spacing (approximately 1.0 cm), could restrict fishing for certain period, undisturbed habitat and guarding could contribute to higher productivity and enhancement of fish biodiversity in the seasonal floodplains. Proper motivation and effective cooperation of the beneficiaries are extremely important to culture fish in the seasonal floodplains under community based management system. Institutional support and constant vigilance from the Department of Fisheries (DoF) and local administrations are indispensable to ensure the sustainability of fish culture initiatives in the seasonal floodplains. Active participation and involvement of the local community people in all stages of fish culture operation beginning from selection of floodplains, formation of floodplain management committee, planning of fish culture activities, exercise of technical intervention, selective stocking with large fingerlings, guarding, monitoring and supervision, adopting harvesting strategies, marketing and distribution of benefits are extremely essential to ensure sustainability of the program. Mutual trust, sense of respect and good working relationship among the committee members are the basic social elements required for the success of community based fish culture initiatives.

253,Patterns of catch and trophic signatures illustrate diverse management requirements of coastal fisheries in Solomon Islands,"Coastal fisheries are a critical component of Pacific island food systems; they power village economies and provide nutritious aquatic foods. Many coastal women and men actively fishing in this region rely on multi-species fisheries, which given their extraordinary diversity are notoriously difficult to both characterize, and to manage. Understanding patterns of fishing, diversity of target species and drivers of these patterns can help define requirements for sustainable management and enhanced livelihoods. Here we use a 12-month data set of 8535 fishing trips undertaken by fishers across Malaita province, Solomon Islands, to create fisheries signatures for 13 communities based on the combination of two metrics; catch per unit effort (CPUE) and catch trophic levels. These signatures are in turn used as a framework for guiding suitable management recommendations in the context of community-based resource management. While a key proximate driver of these patterns was fishing gear (e.g. angling, nets or spearguns), market surveys and qualitative environmental information suggest that community fishing characteristics are coupled to local environmental features more than the market value of specific species they target. Our results demonstrate that even within a single island not all small-scale fisheries are equal, and effective management solutions ultimately depend on catering to the specific environmental characteristics around individual communities.

254,"Community resilience mechanism in an unexpected extreme weather event: An analysis of the Kerala floods of 2018, India","Community actions have a significant role in disaster response. This study analyses the socio-demographic and satisfaction variables within community resilience in the context of the Kerala floods of 2018 and elucidates its gaps from the perspective of a developing country. The data from the self-administered questionnaire survey among the fishermen who were prominent amongst the first responders during this flood were analyzed using SPSS. Global literature was also reviewed to examine the status of community resilience and its effectiveness in holistic disaster management. This is an issue which has rarely been addressed in past studies from India. The results indicate that the majority of the first responder-fishermen had a primary educational background. They have participated in the rescue mission as groups without much previous experience, but felt high levels of self-satisfaction afterwards. These first responders were well aware of coastal disasters, but had limited exposure to disaster preparedness and mock drills. Although hampered by limited physical and financial resources, they could effectively utilize their social capacities during the disaster. The importance of bottom up approach in disaster management, comprising Ã¢â‚¬ËœCommunity-Based Disaster Risk ManagementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (CBDRM) which can transform vulnerable communities to resilient communities is underlined in this study. The importance of the resilience of the local population, especially the fishermen community in local disaster response is highlighted, and the shortcomings in the current practices are identified.

255,"Community-based watershed restoration in He'eia (He'eia ahupua'a), O'ahu, Hawaiian Islands","Historically, Hawaiian lands were divided into ahupua'a, adjacent watersheds stretching from mountains to sea. While communities once farmed, cared for, and sustained a spiritual land ethic toward ahupua'a holistically from mauka (mountainside) to makai (seaside), today many are no longer the clean and productive watersheds they once were as these traditional practices have fallen away. In He'eia, an ahupua'a on the island of O'ahu, several nonprofit organizations are working to revitalize a cohesive ahupua'a management system that can serve as a model for other ahupua'a in Hawai'i and around the Pacific, as well as serve as an example of holistic management practices in the twenty-first century. In the uplands, one organization works to restore the ahupua'a's stream by removing invasive plant species and replanting native flora. In the kula lands (flatlands), another group works to restore the wetland that filters inflow into the bay by planting kalo (taro) and revitalizing traditional Hawaiian polyculture. At the seashore, a third nonprofit is working to restore an 800-year-old fishpond with the intent to promote food security while conducting research on Hawaiian history and water quality. All three groups run extensive educational programs for locals and visitors of all ages and work to keep pollutants out of the watershed and stream as it flows downhill and out onto the reef. By weaving modern technologies, tools, and information together with stories, songs, and attitudes that embody deep and ancient ties between mankind and land, this creative and cooperative management is returning food security, sustainable culture, and resilience to the hands of the community.

256,Dependence on forest resources and tropical deforestation in Ghana,"In Ghana, forests provide many products on which the local population subsists. However, these resources are depleting due to a variety of factors including agricultural expansion and over-exploitation of forest resources. This paper presents an analysis of the level of local dependence on forest resources and its implications for forest management in Ghana. The paper also outlines the causes of continuing deforestation in the studied region from the perspective of the local residents and discusses what role they could play in addressing the problem. The aim is to share more light on the current causes of deforestation and make suggestions for improved community-based forest management practices that could help to reduce deforestation. Primary data was collected through personal interviews and focus group discussions with 431 household heads randomly selected from three Forest Districts in Ghana. The survey showed that income from agriculture constituted 60% of the average total rural household income. Forest income provided 38% of total household income, and off-farm income 2%. The four most highly ranked causes of deforestation are poverty-driven agriculture, lack of alternative rural wage employment other than farming, household population levels, and conflict in traditional land practices. This shows a shift in the view of local people who in the past were quick to blame logging companies and government policies for deforestation. The majority of the respondents depended on wild animals like snail, bush meat, wild honey and wild and cultivated vegetables. Given the reasons for deforestation, much thought needs to go into agroforestry practices (e.g. snail farming, bee keeping, fish farming, and vegetable production) in efforts to reduce deforestation, which are currently less promoted.

257,"Comparison of prone and upright, stereotactic, and tomosynthesis-guided biopsies with secondary analysis of ultrasound-occult architectural distortions","Objectives: Compare prone and upright, stereotactic, and tomosynthesis-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsies (prone DM-VABB, prone DBT-VABB, upright DM-VABB, and upright DBT-VABB) in a community-practice setting and review outcomes of ultrasound-occult architectural distortions (AD). Methods: Consecutive biopsies performed at two community-based breast centers from 2016 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Technical details of each procedure and patient outcomes were recorded. Separate analyses were performed for ultrasound-occult ADs. Two sample t-tests and FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact test facilitated comparisons. Results: A total of 1133 patients underwent 369 prone DM-VABB, 324 prone DBT-VABB, 437 upright DM-VABB, and 123 upright DBT-VABB with 99.2%, 100%, 99.3%, and 99.2% success, respectively (p-values > 0.25). Mean lesion targeting times were greater for prone biopsy (minutes: 6.94 prone DM-VABB, 8.54 prone DBT-VABB, 5.52 upright DM-VABB, and 5.51 upright DBT-VABB; p-values < 0.001), yielding longer total prone procedure times for prone biopsy (p < 0.001). Compared to DM-VABB, DBT-VABB used fewer exposures (p < 0.001) and more commonly targeted AD, asymmetries, or masses (p < 0.001). Malignancy rates were similar between procedures: prone DM-VABB 22.4%, prone DBT-VABB 21.9%, upright DM-VABB 22.8%, and upright DBT-VABB 17.2% (p-values > 0.19). One hundred forty of the 1133 patients underwent 145 biopsies for ultrasound-occult AD (143 DBT-VABB and 2 DM-VABB). Biopsy yielded 27 malignancies and 47 high-risk lesions (74 of 145, 51%). Malignancy rate was 20.7% after surgical upgrade of one benign-discordant and two high-risk lesions. Conclusions: All biopsy procedure types were extremely successful. The 20.7% malignancy rate for ultrasound-occult AD confirms a management recommendation for tissue diagnosis. Upright biopsy was faster than prone biopsy, and DBT-VABB used fewer exposures than DM-VABB. Clinical relevance: Our results highlight important differences between prone DM-VABB, prone DBT-VABB, upright DM-VABB, and upright DBT-VABB. Moreover, the high likelihood of malignancy for ultrasound-occult AD will provide confidence in recommending tissue diagnosis in lieu of observation or clinical follow-up. Key Points: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Upright and prone stereotactic and tomosynthesis-guided breast biopsies were safe and effective in the community-practice setting. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The malignancy rate for ultrasound-occult architectural distortion of 20.7% confirms the management recommendation for biopsy.

258,Sustainability of Community-Based Organizations in Bangladesh,"Community-based management of commons is now widely promoted, but the sustainability of project based institutions has been questioned. In Bangladesh since the mid-1990s many community-based organizations (CBOs) have been formed to manage fisheries and water, empower local communities, and achieve a fairer distribution of benefits. Assessment of 153 CBOs receiving limited facilitation to share lessons revealed that most improved the productivity of their commons and broadened their management activities. They also strengthened governance (transparency in financial management and elections of leaders), and empowerment of the poor including access to natural resources. CBOs involving a range of stakeholders managing larger diverse floodplains and rivers have sustained and improved their practices just as well as where smaller communities manage small, well-defined water bodies. CBOs were able to reduce local conflicts despite complex natural resource interactions, but the long-term future of these achievements depends on an enabling co-management policy.

259,Estimating survival in a remote community-based fishery using acoustic telemetry,"Small-scale fisheries are often considered data poor due to a myriad of complex factors. Precise estimates of key demographic rates are central to the sustainable management of these fisheries.

CormackÃ¢â‚¬â€œJollyÃ¢â‚¬â€œSeber survival estimates were similar for the three top models (quarterly Ãâ€ &gt; 0.80) and detection probability varied with time and as a result of different tag configurations used (pTag type+t ).

260,Adapting to climate change in small-scale fisheries: Insights from indigenous communities in the global north and south,"Integrating traditional institutions into marine resource comanagement has become common across the Pacific. However, these arrangements can link village-based and centralized governance systems in many ways, resulting in new hybridized institutional organizations, operational scales, and governance process. Examining the context-specific social, cultural, and historical processes that shape these programs can reveal how systems for comanagement develop, and how institutional differences influence adaptive capacity. Using analytical tools drawn from critical institutionalism and broad institutional perspectives, we assess how different institutional histories and processes of hybridization informed the adaptive capacity of two comanagement programs in Samoa: the Community-Based Fisheries Management Programme (CBFMP) and the Marine Protected Area (MPA) program. While the programs were embedded in similar cultural and ecological contexts, the MPA program became inactive following the 2009 Pacific tsunami, while the CBFMP endured. In spite of early efforts to involve communities in the MPA programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, the institutional history and organization of the programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s managing agency informed an interpretation of comanagement principles that did not adequately incorporate traditional Samoan institutions for coastal management, reducing its adaptive capacity. In contrast, the CBFMP gained resilience through its fundamental integration with village-based social and political institutions, social norms, and values. This analysis of institutional histories, structures, and program outcomes demonstrates that colonial legacies pose obstacles for successful hybridized governance in the Pacific, while also confirming the valuable contributions integrated traditional institutions can make to improving adaptive capacity.

261,Challenges in managing freshwater fishery resource through Lebak Lebung Auction approach: A case study in Pangkalan Lampam District Ogan Komering Ilir Regency,"Responsible management of fishery resources has been a tradition of Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) of South Sumatera for generations. It was recorded that since 1630 the Dutch Government had made auction policy for managing water territory in OKI Regency as an effort to preserve nature and to avoid the conflict of inland water ownership. Currently, the community-based management model has been adopted by local governments into formal regulations, known as Regional Regulation on Auction of Flood Water Swamp and Rivers (Lelang Lebak Lebung dan Sungai or L3S). This paper describes the success factors and the threats for the failure of the L3S management model in OKI Regency, based on a case study in Pangkalan Lampam District. The study showed that the management mechanism through the L3S system had been well instituted and become a well-established management practice. The management model is in line with the principle of co-management and the approach has become critical success factor in L3S management. However, ecological, economic and social aspects influence the sustainability of such fishery management model.

262,Burial societies in rural ethiopia,"Collective action has both intrinsic and instrumental value. Being part of a group and participating toward meeting a common objective provides direct benefits to individuals. In the Ethiopian survey data used in this study, individuals who reported having larger networks also reported higher levels of happiness. Such correlations are not unique to Ethiopia. Using data from the World Values Survey, Helliwell and Putnam (2004) found that individuals who reported higher levels of individual and collective civic engagement also reported higher scores on measures of subjective well-being. Collective action is also a means to an end. For example, the joint management of irrigation canals, rangelands, and fisheries involves actions by groups that allow individuals to generate higher and more sustainable incomes. This chapter focuses on a specific, instrumental dimension of collective action: the role of groups and networks in helping households in poor communities manage their exposure to risks and cope with shocks to their livelihoods, which are identified as an important determinant of poverty and well-being by Di Gregorio et al. (this volume, Chapter 2). In doing so, the chapter builds on research addressing how poor households respond to shocks; see Morduch (2005) and references therein, the review paper by Skoufias and Quisumbing (2005), and the recent collection edited by Dercon (2005). These show that in the face of shocks households can partially smooth consumption, but not perfectly; as might be expected, idiosyncratic shocks (for instance, low or late rainfall on household plots) are more likely to be insured collectively than are generalized shocks (such as low rainfall on most plots in the village). In most empirical studies of risk smoothing-for example, that of Townsend (1994)-the insurance unit has been assumed to be the village. Studies using Townsend's approach have often found that households are able to cope with idiosyncratic shocks but not covariate shocks, implying that local insurance mechanisms are inadequate to cope with aggregate shocks. More recent studies (for example, that of Munshi and Rosenzweig 2005) have begun to question the assumption that the appropriate unit of risk smoothing is the village. They suggest that consumption is smoothed within subcaste networks that extend beyond the village. Indeed, the literature on migration and remittances suggests that networks can cross geographic boundaries, with the formation of migrant networks at destination sites affected by shocks in the original locality (Munshi 2003). There is also a subset of studies that has attempted to isolate the role of gift giving and informal loans in helping households to cope with shocks. The results indicate that households are not perfectly ""altruistic""; the problems of asymmetric information and limited commitment mean that households are not likely to be fully insured (Foster and Rosenzweig 2000; Ligon, Thomas, and Worral 2000). 1 However, such analyses do not assess whether responses differ depending on the nature of the shock, and indicators for collective action and participation in different types of networks are generally either absent or rudimentary. There are some exceptions. Fafchamps and Lund (2003) differentiated among different types of risk, specifically addressing how different sorts of networks are used. They showed that risk sharing appears to occur mostly in very small networks of close friends and families-networks that may not have the heterogeneity required to efficiently share risk. In the case of Ethiopia, Dercon and Krishnan (2000) specifically addressed potential gender differences in terms of risk coping and found that poor women, particularly in one region, are less able to smooth consumption in the face of risks. The collective action literature shows that the density of networks in general, and participation in more formal groups in particular, can lead to either more effective participation in community-based activities (White and Runge 1994; Isham and Kahkonen 2002) or higher household incomes (Narayan and Pritchett 1999; Pender and Scherr 2002; Haddad and Maluccio 2003). However, there is a lack of consensus on the impact of heterogeneity on collective action. In most empirical studies in which researchers have used various measures of heterogeneity to examine its impact on collective action or on household incomes directly, the impact of any type of heterogeneity has tended to be negative or not significant (Ahuja 1998; Alesina and La Ferrara 2000; Bardhan 2000; McCarthy and Vanderlinden 2004; Place et al. 2004), with the interesting exception of results reported by Grootaert (2001). It is often hypothesized that heterogeneity of any sort makes finding agreements mutually beneficial and acceptable to all more costly and that sociocultural heterogeneity in particular is likely to reduce trust among group members and also to reduce the efficacy of social sanctioning (Easterly and Levine 1997). On the other hand, much of the literature on group formation and networks highlights the added benefits to diversity (or heterogeneity) among members along any number of dimensions. Risk pooling is certainly more efficient when one's income is less correlated with that of other members of the groups, which implies that having members with different agricultural activities and occupational structures is better for the insurance mechanism. Many networks exist to share information; clearly if everyone has the same background and the same current sociocultural and economic profile, there is little need to rely on networks to share information. Finally, there may be economies of scope in terms of information gathering-or accumulation of other assets, for that matter. In this case, economic heterogeneity also favors the pooling of resources to the benefit of all. Because there may be competing impacts of different types of heterogeneity on the functioning of groups, it becomes critical to examine which groups are able to harness the positive effects of heterogeneity and mitigate its negative effects. Finally, if groups differ in terms of degree of heterogeneity and geographic dispersion, what kinds of enforcement mechanisms can be used to ensure compliance with network objectives and norms of behavior? Members of local networks are easier to monitor, but local networks are less able to insure against covariate shocks. Spatially diversified networks offer some protection against covariate shocks, but network members will be more difficult to monitor. If information and communications technologies are poor, more distant network members may not even be aware of a shock that occurred in their original communities. Interest in these issues is more than just a matter of academic curiosity. Understanding these networks is as crucial to understanding the determinants of poverty and the policies necessary to move people out of poverty as understanding land tenure or access to financial capital. A misunderstanding of the roles of these networks can lead to policy changes that have unintended consequences on the functioning of the networks, with potentially damaging effects on the capacity of the poor to mitigate, and cope with, the effects of shocks. At the same time, a better understanding of such networks can lead to the identification of policies that complement networks that already serve the poor well and also to policies that can substitute for networks that simply are not reaching the poor. In terms of the conceptual framework presented in Chapter 2, this chapter focuses on the impact of risks and shocks (especially natural shocks in the form of drought, death, and illness) on household well-being and the role of local collective action institutions in dealing with these risks. We show the impact of asset endowments (human and natural capitals, in particular) on the severity of these shocks, as well as on the composition of the groups and networks. We also discuss the size of collective action institutions and their scope to effectively contribute to poverty and vulnerability reduction. Using the language of the conceptual framework, the discussion focuses almost exclusively on the internal actors (iddir members) in the action arena, which is represented by the iddir (burial societies or funeral association). The patterns of interaction that emerge here are the innovative forms of cooperation (through cash transfers and loans given to iddir members to cope with a shock) and rules (governing that composition and operation of iddir) that allow poor households to achieve certain poverty-related outcomes, such as maintaining necessary levels of income and fulfilling basic needs, as well as sustaining these groups. More generally, this chapter highlights the potential of local forms of collective action beyond economic groups (such as credit and savings associations) to enable poor households to cope with local shocks by overcoming the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection that the typical insurance schemes face. It provides an interesting bridge from the natural resource management (NRM) literature to the non-NRM poverty studies by showing how the same principles that apply to collective action for resource management (effective rules on membership, sanctions for noncompliance, and so on) can translate into non-NRM arenas and create conditions and incentives for effective group operation-in this case, for managing risks. It adds new insights to the discussion of the impact of heterogeneity on the effectiveness and sustain-ability of local groups and networks, which is of great interest and has long been debated in the NRM literature.

In the first case I highlight how El Puente has organized residents to conduct a series of asthma health surveys and tapped into local knowledge of the Latino population to understand potential asthma triggers and to devise culturally relevant health interventions. In a second case I follow The Watchperson Project and their work surveying subsistence anglers and note how the community-gathered information contributed key data inputs for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Cumulative Exposure Project in the neighborhood. In each case I review the processes each organization used to conduct CBPR, some of their findings, and the local knowledge they gathered, all of which were crucial for understanding and addressing local environmental health issues. I conclude with some observations about the benefits and limits of CBPR for helping scientists and communities pursue environmental justice.",NA,No,"The paper's case study is based in Brooklyn, New York, not in any of the Pacific Island nations specified in the screening criteria."," No; The paper is clearly based on a case study from Brooklyn, New York, not any of the listed Pacific Island nations.

264,A DPSIR-analysis of water uses and related water quality issues in the Colombian Alto and Medio Dagua Community Council,"A portion of ColombiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s water resources is located on the Pacific coast within the territory of the Community Council of Alto and Medio Dagua (CC-AMDA). Though a harmonious balance between the communitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ subsistent activities and nature was maintained for centuries, the appearance of modern modes of resource extraction has negatively affected the environment, especially the water resources. The Driver-Pressure-State- Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to analyze water quality problems within this community council. The DPSIR analysis revealed that agriculture, mining, logging and infrastructure development constitute important sectoral drivers with some contribution from tourism and fisheries. Pressures included inputs of organic matter, sediment, nutrients and chemical contaminants to the Dagua river, and to the Bay of Buenaventura. These produced corresponding State changes in the water bodies. Impacts on human welfare were poor public health, reduced food and water security, economic loss and some displacement. Societal Responses included public protests and campaigns, legal actions and policy changes for improved governance. As a future policy option, the formation of community-based water resources management is recommended. Though DPSIR was able to link cause-effect relations, further empirical research on these water bodies is necessary to fill in existing gaps in the data set, particularly for public health threatening contaminants.

265,Development of a case definition for hearing loss in community-based older adults: a cross-sectional validation study,"BACKGROUND: Research based in primary care suggests that hearing loss may be underreported as well as inconsistently recorded in patient histories. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a case definition for hearing loss among older adults in primary care, using electronic medical records. METHODS: We used data from adult patients aged 55 years and older from 13 practices in the Southern Alberta Primary Care Research Network database, part of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), from Dec. 1, 2014, to Dec. 31, 2016. We developed a hearing loss case definition that was translated into an electronic algorithm. A record review was undertaken as the reference standard, followed by application of the algorithm to the sample. Validation metrics included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, as well as prevalence. We assessed risk factors using the Fisher exact test and odds ratios. RESULTS: The sample included 1000 patients; 496 (49.6%) were female and the mean age was 67.5 (standard deviation 9.6) years. Sensitivity of the case definition algorithm was determined to be 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.5%-94.4%) with specificity valued at 94.8% (95% CI 93.1%-96.1%). Positive and negative predictive values were 52.9% (95% CI 42.8%-62.8%) and 99.1% (95% CI 98.2%-99.6%), respectively. The prevalence of hearing loss within the sample was 6.3% (95% CI 4.9%-7.9%). Older age was a significant risk factor for hearing loss (t = 4.98, 95% CI 3.76-8.65). Men had greater odds of hearing loss than women (odds ratio 1.65, 95% CI 0.98-2.79). INTERPRETATION: The validated case definition for hearing loss in community-based older adults had high sensitivity and specificity. It may be applied to surveillance and future epidemiologic research within the CPCSSN database.

Thus, community needs to build the organization and alternative livelihoods must be developed. This study aims to: 1) Asses the socio-economic information; 2) Analyze the dynamic of marine and fisheries activities, and 3) Analyze the activity to improve the capacity of community for coastal resource management. Data were collected during 2017 through interviews using structured and semi-structured questionnaires, both open and closed ones to 42 fishermen/seaweed farmers; 20 respondents from local fishery officers, seaweed collectors, traders, and exporters, processing companies, and coastal women/fishermen's wives. Representatives of 11 relevant stakeholders were also interviewed. The result shows that coastal community livelihood activities in Takalar District consist of fishing, aquaculture, and the processing of fishery products. Fishing activities carried out by fishermen using the size <5 GT vessels and fishing gear such as nets and fishing rods. There is growing aquaculture in seaweed commodities particularly Eucheuma cottonii and Eucheuma spinosum, while for Gracilaria sp., and Caulerva sp. were started to be developed.

267,Ecologically sustainable but unjust? Negotiating equity and authority in common-pool marine resource management,"Under appropriate conditions, community-based fisheries management can support sound resource stewardship, with positive social and environmental outcomes. Evaluating indigenous peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ involvement in commercial sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, we found that the current social-ecological system configuration is relatively ecologically sustainable according to stock assessments. However, the current system also results in perceived inequities in decisionmaking processes, harvesting allocations, and socioeconomic benefits. As a result, local coastal resource managers envision a transformation of sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries governance and management institutions. We assessed the potential robustness of the proposed institutions using Elinor OstromÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s common-pool resource design principles. Grounded in the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legal, political, and historical context, our analysis suggests that greater local involvement in these invertebrate fisheries and their management could provide more benefits to local communities than the status quo while maintaining an ecologically sustainable resource. Our research highlights the importance of explicitly addressing historical context and equity considerations in social-ecological system analyses and when renegotiating the institutions governing common-pool resources.

268,The impact of community-based fisheries management (CBFM) on equity and sustainability of small-scale coastal fisheries in the Philippines,"It was realized that with the increasing rate of deterioration of fisheries resource in the Philippines, there was no way the country could pursue a pathway of sustainable development. After enactment of the Local Government Code of 1991, the government actively promoted community-based fisheries management (CBFM) to conserve the coastal resources. The increased attention paid to community-based fisheries management has come about through experience of the poor performance of other approaches and through the study of traditional systems of community management of natural resources which have not only survived but also appear to perform better than the alternatives. This paper presents the results of a study to assess the impacts of CBFM projects in the Philippines, using meta-analysis, on the equity and sustainability of small-scale coastal fisheries. The outcomes indicate a positive impact of CBFM on the equity of both involvement in management and benefit sharing and sustainable management of fisheries resources through the investigation of effective magnitude (effect size) based on eight indicators. The positive summary effect sizes of participation, influence, control, access, and income conjunctly portrayed an improved equity in the fishing community by implementing CBFM. The positive summary effect sizes of compliance and conflict indicated an affirmative community and, therefore, sustainable fisheries management. While the negative summary effect size of resource revealed the difficulties in recovering fish abundance in a relatively short period of time. Also, ten years of implementation of CBFM was discovered as the minimum duration with perceived equity and sustainability improvement for most indicators.

In this paper we examined local peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ appreciation on the values of PSF and their contribution to conservation. The study was carried out by interviewing 100 respondents living in adjacent to North Selangor PSF and holding three focus group discussions and a few key-informantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ interviews following participatory rural appraisal and contingent valuation methods. Respondents appreciated PSF for direct values including timber, non-timber forest products, source of fish, and water for agriculture. They reported environmental values of PSF like flood prevention, biodiversity conservation, fresh air, soil fertility, perennial water source, and reduction of storm damages. They also reported several health and cultural benefits including sources of medicinal plants, fresh food, and agro-tourism. The monetary values of some benefits were estimated as USD 128/month/family (for fish), USD 128/month/family (agro-tourism) and USD 159,070/year (irrigation). Although direct benefits from PSF were minimal, respondents sincerely wanted to contribute to PSF conservation through participation in community-based rehabilitation project, patrolling and fire protection, tree planting, cash donation, supplying seedlings, and joining in awareness creation programme. The intrinsic values and peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ enthusiasm for PSF conservation suggest a community-based approach for sustainable PSF management.

270,Salient beliefs underlying donating to Caring for Children in Belize,"Understanding why individuals in developing countries donate to their own community health programs and humanitarian efforts is an important aspect in the success of these efforts. In this study, we elicited the beliefs underlying community members' willingness to donate to Caring for Children (CFC), a Belizean program relying on local community donations to support children affected by HIV/AIDS. A salient-belief elicitation, based on the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA), was conducted with 90 adults residing in Cayo and Corozal districts of Belize. Participants were asked six open-ended questions about perceived advantages/disadvantages (consequences) of donating, people who approve/disapprove (social referents) of them donating, and things that make it easy/hard (circumstances) to donate to CFC. Content and frequency analyses indicated that individuals perceived a variety of consequences of donating including advantages of donating ranging from community to personal benefits and disadvantages including concerns of misuse of donations. In terms of social referents, individuals perceived that community groups and churches approve of them donating, with no disapproving social referents consistently reported. Finally, circumstances impacting donations to CFC included getting information about how CFC operates, having enough resources, and convenience of drop-off locations. Fisher's Exact Tests further revealed some differences in beliefs based on sample characteristics. These results offer specific sites for activities to potentially increase donations and community support to CFC while also providing avenues for further research into investigating donating behaviors. These findings may be applicable to other community-based organizations that heavily depend on local community donations to support their programs.

As an open-Access resource, allowing a monopoly is considered to prevent conflicts of resource struggle and overuse. But in practice, the auction is precisely the cause of overexploitation, and the local community loses access to fishing. This study is intended to describe the suitability of Culture-Based Fisheries (CBF) implementation in the rawa lebak lebung in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) Regency based on practices under the auction regime, water quality, and aquatic biota communities.

272,Creating a TURF from the bottom-up: Antigua's community-based coral reef no-take reserve,"Antigua's coral reefs are among the most degraded in the Caribbean region, having low coral cover, few herbivores, and abundant harmful macroalgae. Low fish biomass suggests overfishing may contribute to degradation and lack of recovery to a coral-dominated state. However, coral reefs declined so long ago that most stakeholders have never seen a healthy reef ecosystem. Therefore, fishers today may not be able to imagine ecosystem services provided by healthy reefs. No-take reserves can reverse degradation by increasing herbivore abundance, reducing macroalgae, and increasing juvenile coral abundance, which, with time, should increase coral cover. Although Antigua designated marine protected areas, they are functionally ""paper parks"" with low compliance due to inadequate management and enforcement, and little community support. In 2014, we conducted meetings and interviews with fishers resulting in a community-based, no-take reserve managed by fishers in their fishing territory, which is unprecedented in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Our objective was to create a demonstration project for the fishing community so they can see the effects and profit from spillover of adults into the area they fish. Fishers interviewed described their perspective of the reef and the history of fishing. They supported the creation of a demonstration reserve and assisted in monitoring for compliance. This is the first collective action known to have occurred among Antiguan fishers. After 1 yr, biomass increased significantly in the reserve for all targeted fish species and for non-target species. One year after the reserve was established, parrotfish biomass increased and macroalgae decreased significantly based on repeated belt and point-intercept transects, respectively.

273,"Promoting women's leadership under environmental decentralization: The roles of domestic policy, foreign aid, and population change","In recent decades, countries across Asia, Latin America, and Africa have adopted environmental decentralization reforms to encourage the community-based management of water, forests, fisheries, and other natural resources. While such reforms are meant to empower rural people to participate in environmental governance, experiences from recent decades suggest that these reforms often suffer from gendered inequalities in participation and leadership. We use the case of a forestry-sector decentralization reform in Nepal to test the importance of domestic policy, foreign aid, and population change for promoting women's leadership under environmental decentralization. Using data on local natural resource governance committees formed in villages across the country under the reform, we find that a non-binding government guideline encouraging committees to prioritize women's leadership resulted in an estimated increase of 7.5% points in the number of leadership seats held by women on these committees. We also show that locally-targeted, sector-specific foreign aid projects appear to have a strong impact, with rates of women's leadership that are estimated to be 24% points higher in committees formed in areas with projects, compared to rates in comparable committees formed in areas without such projects at the time of formation. Finally, we instrument for international male out-migration in rural Nepal, and find no apparent effect of international male out-migration on rates of women's leadership in local natural resource governance committees. The results highlight the importance of domestic policy, even without stringent enforcement, and targeted foreign aid projects for promoting women's leadership under environmental decentralization.

274,Impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security: a global perspectiveÃ¢â‚¬â€a review article,"Climate change is happening due to natural factors and human activities. It expressively alters biodiversity, agricultural production, and food security. Mainly, narrowly adapted and endemic species are under extinction. Accordingly, concerns over species extinction are warranted as it provides food for all life forms and primary health care for more than 60Ã¢â‚¬â€œ80% of humans globally. Nevertheless, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security has been recognized, little is explored compared to the magnitude of the problem globally. Therefore, the objectives of this review are to identify, appraise, and synthesize the link between climate change, biodiversity, and food security. Data, climatic models, emission, migration, and extinction scenarios, and outputs from previous publications were used. Due to climate change, distributions of species have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0Ã‚Â m and 16.9Ã‚Â km per decade to higher latitudes. Accordingly, extinction rates of 1103 species under migration scenarios, provide 21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ23% with unlimited migration and 38Ã¢â‚¬â€œ52% with no migration. When an environmental variation occurs on a timescale shorter than the life of the plant any response could be in terms of a plastic phenotype. However, phenotypic plasticity could buffer species against the long-term effects of climate change. Furthermore, climate change affects food security particularly in communities and locations that depend on rain-fed agriculture. Crops and plants have thresholds beyond which growth and yield are compromised. Accordingly, agricultural yields in Africa alone could be decline by more than 30% in 2050. Therefore, solving food shortages through bringing extra land into agriculture and exploiting new fish stocks is a costly solution, when protecting biodiversity is given priority. Therefore, mitigating food waste, compensating food-insecure people conserving biodiversity, effective use of genetic resources, and traditional ecological knowledge could decrease further biodiversity loss, and meet food security under climate change scenarios. However, achieving food security under such scenario requires strong policies, releasing high-yielding stress resistant varieties, developing climate resilient irrigation structures, and agriculture. Therefore, degraded land restoration, land use changes, use of bio-energy, sustainable forest management, and community based biodiversity conservation are recommended to mitigate climate change impacts.

The SÃƒÂ£o Francisco River Estuary (SFRE, Brazil Northeast) comprises significant mangrove forests, important for human populations, and is included in an Environmental Protected Area of sustainable use which does not have a management plan. This work assessed and mapped anthropogenic activities on the mangroves of this estuary and provided a number of guidelines for a local management plan. Satellite images (SPOT 5 and CBERS 2B) of 2008 were processed and a land use/cover map (study area size: 192.4km2) produced and verified by fieldwork. About 93% (178.8km2) of the study area is occupied by natural cover such as: sandy coastal vegetation (147.3km2, 77%), mangroves (30.1km2, 15.7%) and intertidal flats (1.4km2, 0.7%), while 7% (13.6km2) is occupied by human activities as aquaculture (4.5km2, 2.4%) and agriculture (9km2, 4.7%). These uses are spatially distributed within mangroves, accounting for approximately one quarter (7.8km2) of its area, which may indicate the conversion of these forests. Shrimp farming is the main anthropogenic activity, occupying the highest area and occurring within the tallest Rhizophora mangle forests (tree height &gt;15m). We recommend that a management plan for the SFRE considers: the implementation of sustainable aquaculture practices (e.g. small-scale without deforestation of mangroves, use of native species, effluent treatment, socio-economic equity), strategies for the compliance of the laws regarding shrimp farming license and operation and support the creation of community-based cooperatives for the execution of sustainable aquaculture.

277,"Community Development for Bote in Chitwan National Park, Nepal: A Political Ecology of Development Logic of Erasure","The conflict between development and conservation concerns is a perennial topic in sustainable development, and especially significant for marginalized social groups. In Nepal, fortress conservation in protected areas (PA) gave way to a community-based development and natural resource management (CBNRM) narrative of inclusion and participation in so-called buffer zone (BZ) initiatives around national parks. Studies to date show mixed outcomes of the community-based model for marginalized communities, especially for traditional indigenous river and forest dwellers. Academic and government reports of successes and failures of community-based projects in Nepal assume progress is based on traditional indigenous livelihood practices being abandoned and participation in state modernization initiatives in parks and reserves. Thus, despite promises of participation, evidence to date shows a de facto continuation of fortress conservation thinking and erasure of customary knowledge and livelihoods. Based on an ethnographic inquiry informed by political ecology conducted in two villages of Bote IPs (in the buffer zone area) of the Nawalparasi District of Chitwan National Park (CNP), we describe how state interventions and regulations under the guise of community-based participation actively ignore the moral ecology of traditional riverine livelihoods while pursuing a modernization project.

278,Integrating comanagement and land tenure policies for the sustainable management of the Lower Amazon floodplain,"The ten years between the first and second conferences have been a time of considerable importance for the conservation of the Amazon vÃƒÂ¡rzea based on the comanagement of floodplain resources. This paper describes the development of a regional comanagement system in the Lower Amazon vÃƒÂ¡rzea. The comanagement system has grown out of the grassroots movement, known as the acordos de pesca, in which floodplain communities asserted control over their traditional lake fisheries. In the 1990s these agreements provided the basis for IBAMA's development of a community-based comanagement policy for floodplain fisheries. The evolving vÃƒÂ¡rzea comanagement system has developed in three phases: (1) IBAMA developed and implemented a fisheries comanagement pollcy in the SantarÃƒÂ©m region; (2) individual vÃƒÂ¡rzea communities and the Public Ministry negotiated agreements, Termos de Ajuste de Conduta (TACS), with local cattle owners to regulate cattle grazing on community grasslands;, and (3) these comanagement agreements were integrated into a more comprehensive land tenure and settlement policy based on the Projeto de Assentamento Agroextractivista (PAEs). Thus far 41 vÃƒÂ¡rzea PAEs have been created, including some 13,000 families and covering a total area of 740,000 ha in eight Lower Amazonian municipalities. These PAEs are now in the process of preparing the Utilization and Settlement Development Plans needed to obtain environmental licences. A major long-term investment is needed to take advantage of this process and integrate these PAEs into municipal and regional comanagement institutions.

280,An overview of increasing incidents of bottlenose dolphin harassment in the gulf of Mexico and possible solutions,"The panhandle region of the Gulf of Mexico is known by scientists, regulatory agencies and conservation organizations as a ""hotbed"" area of dolphin harassment. Interactions between humans and wild dolphins routinely occur through close vessel approaches or through direct contact associated with commercial or recreational fisheries, swim-with, or feeding activities. Such interactions are of serious concern for wild dolphin welfare and conservation under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, as well as for human safety. In recent years, an alarming number of dolphins in this region have been fatally wounded by gunshot, hunting arrows, or sharp tools (i.e., screwdriver). The potential to mitigate the detrimental impacts resulting from these human-dolphin encounters requires a comprehensive outreach strategy to address increasing incidents of harassment and vandalism, as well as an evaluation of the serious trends and challenges hampering dolphin protection in this region. In addition to the identification and conviction of perpetrators through the application of existing law, voluntary outreach programs offer real potential to educate and reform public attitudes and behaviors through community-based stewardship initiatives, which can foster dolphin protection in areas of high human-dolphin conflict. The development of these types of programs underlines the potential for non-regulatory approaches to serve as an effective means to reach and activate the public on some of the most pressing local and regional marine conservation issues. In tandem with regulations and enforcement, voluntary stewardship programs can provide stakeholders an opportunity to engage in local dolphin conservation efforts through a positive approach aimed to inspire accountability.

Navigating the process of policy implementation in small-scale fisheries in South Africa,"The development and implementation of a new small-scale fisheries policy in South Africa has been a protracted and convoluted process. Following a participatory policy formulation process, founded on human-rights principles and a commitment to a community-based approach to governance, implementation planning and policy-roll-out have deviated from these foundational principles leading to thousands of fishers being left out of the process and the persistence of state-centric management. Drawing on the fisheries governance and policy implementation literature, the paper systematically analyses the transition from the small-scale policy formulation process to implementation and highlights the governance processes and other factors that have resulted in a mismatch between policy rhetoric and implementation practices. Key factors that have contributed to this policy disjuncture include a lack of ongoing engagement and collaboration with stakeholders, adopting a one-size fits all approach, inappropriate legal mechanisms to operationalise the policy, issuing of individual permits in the interim period, shifting political agendas, changing socio-economic factors at national and local level, lack of resources and capacity to implement policy objectives, implementation delays and lack of clarity regarding implementation agencies. Insights from this analysis in relation to policy implementation theory and empirical studies are discussed. The paper concludes with proposals for addressing the mismatches.

283,"Community-Based Tourism and Political Communitarianism in Prainha do Canto Verde, Brazil","Community-based tourism is advocated by indigenous organizations and leftist actors throughout Latin America as a tool for furthering their political and cultural agenda. The ideological biases and structural weaknesses of this model become apparent in a case study of the fishing village of Prainha do Canto Verde, Brazil. The communitarian agenda currently being implemented by means of the community-based tourism project in Prainha is based upon an ideological construct and being imposed through political engineering upon what is simply a local segment of Brazilian rural society. As a result, it is encountering strong resistance. There is also structural tension between the inevitable sociocultural change caused by the development of tourism and the rigidity and essentialism of a community-based tourism model offering a Ã¢â‚¬Å“traditional way of lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â as a touristic product. The model is ultimately conflictual and unstable, and there is serious doubt about its long-term sustainability.

284,Factors in overcoming barriers to implementing co-management in British Columbia salmon fisheries,"Ten years of research and efforts to implement co-management in British Columbia fisheries have demonstrated that we lack neither good models nor the political will in communities to design and test local and regional institutions for successful involvement in various aspects of management. The barriers lie rather in the distrust and resistance of management agencies and the lack of broadly organized political support. The nature of the barriers and some of the elements of a successful approach to overcoming them are identified and discussed. The analysis is focused around the barriers encountered by two differently situated fishing communities or regions that have launched conservation initiatives through cooperation between local aboriginal and nonaboriginal fishing groups. In attempting to overcome the political barriers, the communities seek to develop expertise in selective fishing technology for more sustainable harvest, principled multi-stakeholder negotiation, marketing, shared databases, and preliminary ecosystem monitoring. The communities exemplify small- and medium-scale bottom-up approaches to adaptive management. The analysis shows the key and possibly unique contributions of processes at these levels, and suggests how they can be scaled up and linked to processes at other levels. Both types of analysis are largely missing in adaptive management theory, which has tended to focus on larger scale processes and to dismiss the potential of smaller scale ones to transform, expand, and link. This analysis focuses on salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) fisheries of British Columbia, Canada, but the literature suggests that the findings have far broader applicability.

285,Indicators of the ecological impact of bottom-trawl disturbance on seabed communities,"The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries requires that managers take account of the environmental impacts of fishing. We develop linked state and pressure indicators that show the impact of bottom-trawling on benthic communities. The state indicator measures the proportion of an area where benthic invertebrate biomass (B) or production (P) is more than 90% of pristine benthic biomass (B 0.9) or production (P0.9). The pressure indicator measures the proportion of the area where trawling frequency is sufficiently high to prevent reaching predicted B0.9 or P0.9. Time to recovery to B0.9 and P0.9 after trawling, depending on the habitat, was estimated using a validated size-based model of the benthic community. Based on trawling intensity in 2003, 53.5% of the southern North Sea was trawled too frequently for biomass to reach B0.9, and 27.1% was trawled too frequently for production to reach P0.9. As a result of bottom-trawling in 2003, in 56% of the southern North Sea benthic biomass was below B0.9, whereas in 27% of the southern North Sea benthic production was below P0.9. Modeled recovery times were comparable to literature estimates (2.5 to more than 6 years). The advantages of using the area with an ecological impact of trawling as a pressure indicator are that it is conceptually easy to understand, it responds quickly to changes in management action, it can be implemented at a relevant scale for fisheries management, and the necessary effort distribution data are centrally collected. One of this approach's greatest utilities, therefore, will be to communicate to policy makers and fishing enterprises the expected medium- to long-term ecological benefits that will accrue if the frequency of trawling in particular parts of fishing grounds is reduced.

286,"Community-based management fails to halt declines of bumphead parrotfish and humphead wrasse in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands","Community-based fisheries management that integrates local knowledge and existing user rights is often seen as a solution to the failures of top-down fisheries management in the Pacific. In Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon Islands, a network of community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) was established in the early 2000s to conserve declining populations of bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) and other locally valuable fish species such as humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus). We aimed to evaluate the success of these protected areas at preventing declines of B. muricatum and C. undulatus. We conducted 27 underwater visual census (UVC) surveys at permanent passage and outer reef monitoring sites in Roviana Lagoon in 2018 and compared our findings with results from 72 UVC surveys that we had conducted at the same sites 18Ã‚Â yrs earlier. We also interviewed Roviana spearfishers about their maximum nightly B. muricatum catches from 2018, the early 2000s and the 1980s. Abundances of all B. muricatum and C. undulatus sighted on UVC surveys declined by 62% and 57%, respectively, between 2000 and 2018, and abundances of adult B. muricatum and C. undulatus declined by 78% and 72%, respectively, over the same period. Using a joint model of B. muricatum abundance and its reported maximum catch, we estimated that in 2018 the population of B. muricatum was 8% of its 1980Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s abundance. By modelling projected rates of decline over three generations, we show that populations of B. muricatum and C. undulatus in Roviana Lagoon meet the IUCN Red List thresholds for Critically Endangered (CR). The probable causes of these declines are sustained fishing pressure, poor enforcement of community-based management measures and loss of fish nursery habitats due to logging. Our findings suggest urgent co-management of the ridge-to-reef system is needed to prevent further fish population declines in Roviana Lagoon.

287,Creating multi-functional landscapes: Using exclusion fences to frame feral ungulate management preferences in remote Aboriginal-owned northern Australia,"Invasive species can have negative and positive impacts for local communities. Conflict between these different values can complicate and sometimes prevent broad-scale management and decision-making. Multi-functional landscapes and community-based conservation paradigms have emerged as constructive approaches to integrating competing interests and the development of sustainable and locally meaningful management planning. Here, we report on a five year feral ungulate exclusion fence project that was used to focus local people's attention on the eco-cultural and socio-economic impacts of feral ungulate invasion in a remote Aboriginal-owned region of northern Australia. Exclusion of feral buffalo, horses and pigs from three culturally significant freshwater billabongs from 2009 to 2013 resulted in variable increases in smooth ground (from 64-93%), ground cover vegetation (from 18-95%) and water lily cover (bush food) (from 20-60%), dependent on the site. The reduction in feral animal ground surface damage in the fenced areas was fastest at the floodplain billabong, Nalawan, which took only a year to become negligible. At the two channel billabongs, Costello and Namaliwiri, feral animal damage was negligible after 3 years. Senior Aboriginal Traditional Owners of these areas were pleased that these environmental assets were protected, but only agreed on the wholesale culling of pigs. Despite recognition of the negative eco-cultural impacts of feral ungulates as observed through the exclusion fence project, they wanted to maintain buffalo and horse on their Country to financially benefit from potential pet-meat and live export industries. Fencing was requested for culturally meaningful sites including those that were used for fishing and were sacred. Fenced areas were viewed by Traditional Owners as ""protected"" areas of ecological and cultural resources. These multiple management preferences can be combined to build socio-ecological resilience into regional strategic planning for feral ungulate management that will deliver multiple benefits for local communities.

288,The micro-politics of small-scale fisheries governance in South Africa: a case study of community-based political representation as a form of brokerage,"The right of small-scale fishers to participate in governance and management processes has been increasingly recognised by theorists and policy-makers over the last thirty years. Political representation is central to the realisation of the right to participation. In the context of small-scale fisheries, the first level of political representation is usually located within a spatially or socially defined Ã¢â‚¬ËœcommunityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, where both fisher constituents and representatives are members of that community. This Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcommunity-basedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ form of political representation requires representatives to speak and act on behalf of their fisher constituency, mediating the relationship between their constituency and external actors such as government officials, fisheries scientists, and fish buyers. The role of mediation or Ã¢â‚¬ËœbrokerageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ places community-based representatives in a position of strategic advantageÃ¢â‚¬â€œa position that some representatives exploit to gain and exercise their own power, instead of protecting and asserting the interests of their constituency. Community-based political representation commonly manifests as brokerage, yet this phenomenon receives limited attention in predominant approaches to fisheries governance theory. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in a South African coastal town, this paper seeks to demonstrate, at a micro-political scale, some of the ways that community-based representation can be manipulated as an instrument for brokerage by local elites, rather than serving as an instrument for empowering the livelihoods and democratic participation of small-scale fishers. The paper concludes by highlighting some of the implications that community-based representation has for fishing communities, as well as for the practice of fisheries governance and management. Finally, the paper argues for the necessity of a critical perspective when theorising fisheries governance processes, so as to confront and interrogate the strategic practices and asymmetrical power relations by which those governance processe are decisively shaped.

289,"Social capital, community-based governance and resilience in an African artisanal river fishery","This is a study of a community-based fishery on the Rovuma River that forms the border between Mozambique and Tanzania. We postulate a relationship between social capital and community-based governance over access to and the use of the fish resource. In historical times social capital was high and community-based governance regulated access to and use of the fishery as a common property resource. Transforming forces particularly colonial administration, advocating Christianity, war and an emerging market economy undermined social capital, which in turn affected community-based governance. The deconstruction of social capital has resulted in attitudes and behaviours that challenge governance processes with dire consequences for sustainable resource utilisation. Harvesting of fish stocks occurs at levels that are no longer sustainable and inappropriate practices are being adopted. While the Mozambique government policy promotes community-based fisheries management in artisanal fisheries, we argue that under current conditions of ineffective community-based governance, a strong focus on reconstruction of social capital will be required before a community-based resource management process can be effectively implemented. The findings are discussed in the context of resilience in social ecological systems. We suggest that given the historical context in which community-based natural resource management is promoted within southern Africa such a focus may have wide relevance.",NA,No,"The study is based in Mozambique and Tanzania, not in any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The abstract clearly states that the study is based on a community-based fishery on the Rovuma River that forms the border between Mozambique and Tanzania, which are not among the countries listed in the SC.

290,Counting what counts: using local knowledge to improve Arctic resource management,"The climate is changing and the people in the Arctic are facing huge challenges. Many rely on natural resources for both subsistence and income. Successful adaptation to climate change and the sustainable use of resources requires observation of the environment. Scientific knowledge of the environment is incomplete and conventional scientific monitoring is logistically difficult. Local fishers and hunters observe the environment all year-round. Their observations and knowledge are, however, not consistently quantified, analyzed, or used for resource management. We present a simple, field-based system for monitoring and managing resources developed specifically to enable Greenlandic fishers and hunters to document trends in living resources and to propose management decisions themselves. This system was designed to build upon existing informal observing methods, and there is interest in the system among rural fishers and hunters. We describe correspondence between community members' perceptions and professional scientists' assessments of the abundance of sea-ice, shipping, fish, mammals, and birds. Community-based documentation can pinpoint particular species and areas that are in need of attention. At the same time, it can help link observed environmental changes to management action. We hope this paper will encourage other stakeholders to develop their own local monitoring systems so as to facilitate adaptive management responses at both local and national levels.

291,Local awareness and perceptions: Consequences for conservation of marsh habitat at Lake Alaotra for one of the world's rarest lemurs,"Management and monitoring of community-based protected areas in Madagascar remain challenging because of a lack of financial, human and technical resources, and capacity. At Lake Alaotra, conversion of marshland for rice cultivation and a lack of effective habitat protection have pushed the locally endemic Alaotra gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis to the brink of extinction. The highest density of the species is found in the locally managed Park Bandro, a high-priority conservation zone within the Lake Alaotra New Protected Area. We evaluated local awareness and perceptions of Park Bandro, and discussed preferred management options with local communities. Two questionnaire surveys were carried out, one with 180 participants at six sites around the lake and marsh, and another with 50 participants in the village adjacent to Park Bandro. The majority of participants knew of the existence of Park Bandro but most did not know its purpose or size. Values and perceptions of local communities were influenced by occupation and distance to the Park, with fishers being most aware of the Park. We found that local people had a high level of environmental awareness and were willing to discuss zonation and alternative resource management strategies as long as these activities could provide a tangible livelihood benefit. Lack of awareness among local resource users regarding the purpose and status of protected areas such as Park Bandro is a challenge that needs to be addressed, and one that is relevant for environmental education and management of protected areas throughout Madagascar.

292,Participatory modeling and community dialog about vulnerability of lobster fishing to climate change,"The US National Research Council has repeatedly called for an analytic-deliberative process to make environmental decisions. Such a process should bring together experts, local citizens, stakeholders, and decision makers in venues where they investigate, discuss and learn together, make decisions, and follow up with monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment. In this spirit, we have developed a community-based participatory modeling experience that gathers and organizes local and expert knowledge and then uses the model to inform public policy dialog. This chapter tells the story of how, over 24 months, we engaged a group of lobstermen and community members in South Thomaston, Maine. The group characterized how climate change is impacting the lobster fishery and the community. It also identified resilience actions they could take to better understand the complex connections between fishing effort, timing of lobster molting, and the price of lobster. We used system dynamics modeling to estimate these connections using available data from participants, scientific reports and publications, and data gathered by regulatory authorities. The model lets participants run scenarios that characterize how different resilience action strategies affect landings and fishermenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s income. We met with individual lobstermen to fine-tune the model and to explore its applications and then presented the model and its simulations back to the community. We also prepared a booklet that summarized NOAA data about ocean temperatures and distributed it in the community. These products helped promote community deliberation about how to enhance resilience to climate change.

293,Movement and mortality of invasive suckermouth armored catfish during a spearfishing control experiment,"Control of non-native, invasive species in groundwater-dependent ecosystems that are also inhabited by regionally endemic or at-risk species represents a key challenge in aquatic invasive species management. Non-native suckermouth armored catfish (SAC; family Loricariidae) have invaded freshwater ecosystems on a global scale, including the groundwater-dependent upper San Marcos River in Texas, USA. We used passive integrated transponder tags to follow the movements and fates of 65 fish in a 1.6Ã‚Â km spring-fed reach of the upper San Macros River to assess the efficacy of a community-based spearfishing bounty hunt for controlling SAC. We found the weekly probability of SAC survival was negatively correlated with the number of fish removed as a part of the bounty hunt each week (P = 0.003, R2 = 0.86), while the probability of SAC being speared and reported was positively correlated with the number of fish removed (P = 0.011, R2 = 0.53). The majority of SAC used &lt; 25 m2 of river over a nine-week tracking period, but the area of river fish used correlated positively with the number of relocations (P &lt; 0.001, R2 = 0.36) as might be expected for a population that disperses through diffusive spread. These findings collectively suggest local-scale suppression of the SAC population is possible through community engagement in spearfishing, but over longer time periods immigration might offset some of the removal success. This conclusion provides an explanation for the pattern in which long-term spearfishing tournaments have reduced biomass but ultimately not resulted in eradication of the population.

294,Saugeen Ojibway Nation community input and action: Initiating a two-eyed seeing approach for dikameg (Coregonus clupeaformis) in Lake Huron,"Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi'kmaw) involves seeing with the strengths of Indigenous ways of knowing through one eye, that of Western ways through the other, and using both eyes together to benefit all. Originating from Mi'kmaw Elder Dr. Albert Marshall, its benefits have been demonstrated across a broad array of disciplines, including fisheries research and management. We initiate a Two-Eyed Seeing approach to inform research priorities and explore solutions for the co-managed Saugeen Ojibway Nation lake whitefish (dikameg in Anishinaabemowin) fishery, in light of recent declines that remain poorly understood. We held interviews with harvesters and community members from the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation and the Chippewas of Saugeen First Nation through focus groups in each community, in addition to surveys that were completed at a community celebration in Nawash, to draw from the communitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ knowledge related to causes of dikameg declines, actions that could be taken to address them, and the future of the fishery in Lake Huron. Participants identified 19 themes, of which the most frequently mentioned were: 1) Harvesting, 2) Non-indigenous and invasive species, 3) Stocking of other fish species, 4) Habitat and water quality, 5) Assisting dikameg reproduction, 6) People and the community, 7) Ecological effects, and 8) Aquaculture and hatcheries for dikameg.

295,"Threat Perception of Stakeholders: Case study of Loktak Lake, a Ramsar Site under Montreux Record in North East India","Identifying, assessing, and addressing threats are vital elements in the management plan formulation of a protected area. Loktak Lake, a Ramsar Wetland of international importance placed under the Montreux Record since 1993, exemplifies this need. The study focuses on 11 direct threats in Loktak Lake based on a standard classification nomenclature by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Three different parameters (scope, severity and magnitude) were assessed using a rating scale from four stakeholder groups (Government Departments, Experts, Community Based Organizations and Fisherman Community). Eight of these direct threats were prioritised based on high ratings in the assessment among which the absence of fishing bans, the inflow of municipal waste and the maintenance of the water level by Ithai Barrage showed significant differences in threat perception among stakeholders. The study also showed the resource conflicts underpinning some of the highly ranked threats such as encroachment in peripheral areas and absence of fishing bans. The heterogeneity in stakeholder groups and their select dependence on resource use explains the significant differences observed in the prioritisation of the threats. The study demonstrated the use of threat ranking as an efficient method for management plan formulation in a conservation site. It also highlighted the urgent need to address the gaps observed in the management plans with regard to present management interventions.

In January 2012, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board launched the Community-Based Monitoring Network (CBMN) to document current Inuit harvesting practices using modern technology by engaging Inuit harvesters in Nunavut who hunt, fish, gather, and observe wildlife. We provide an overview of the CBMN and discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrating data gathered through the CBMN in co-management decision-making. The CBMN has resulted in the collection of 7225 wildlife harvest and 2623 observation records by 85 harvesters in seven communities during 5594 on the land trips covering a combined area of approximately 400 000 km2. The CBMN represents a powerful approach to knowledge production by Inuit harvesters that is relevant to wildlife managers and co-management agencies.

297,Trindade and the Struggle for its Territory: A Trajectory of Community Empowerment and Self-Governance in Southeastern Coast of Brazil,"Trindade is a CaiÃƒÂ§ara community situated in the municipality of Paraty, southeastern coast of Brazil. Its livelihood is based mainly on tourism and small-scale fishing. This chapter gives an account on how people of Trindade have been responding to land tenure pressures since almost 50 years now. The main objective of this chapter is to unveil Trindade dynamics favoring community self-organization and empowerment as coping strategies for territorial autonomy. We focus on answering how the capacity of self-organization and empowerment of the community of Trindade towards its territorial autonomy contributed to the establishment of a community school, named as the School of the Sea. A qualitative case study was used. Data was collected through interviews, participative and direct observations as well as secondary data. Results show that TrindadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history on self-organizing follows a clear pattern of events which have triggered responses reinforcing self-organization and empowerment of the community. These events are defined by land invasion over the territory of Trindade; tourism boom; implementation of protected areas; reform of a local Festival; and the death of a young resident of the community. The most recent response to these events has been the establishment of the School of the Sea. This initiative was made possible due to the organizational conditions of the community-based organizations of Trindade; the demand of a group of mothers of Trindade; the development of an Education Program in other CaiÃƒÂ§ara communities of Paraty, among others.

Naturally, these water bodies are incapable of supporting self-recruiting fisheries, but can be utilized to enhance the fish production significantly through development of culture-based fisheries (CBF), without causing impediment on their primary use. CBF in village reservoirs of Sri Lanka is a communal activity, and the water bodies used for this purpose are rural, thus benefiting rural communities by augmenting their traditional means of incomes and also increased food-fish availability. CBF is a non-water consumptive secondary activity that brings into play communities that were not engaged in fishery-related activities previously. It is also environmentally friendly, as the only external input is the seed stock. CBF is a present day paradigm of ecosystem-based aquaculture. CBF has developed as a result of coordinated efforts of a multitude of stakeholders, working in unison, resulting in developing and improving the knowledge base, facilitating required legislative change, such as in the case of amendment of the Agrarian Development Act, and issue of a governmental decree permitting and encouraging CBF in Sri Lanka and community organizations. CBF is a sustainable activity that also impinges on bringing better harmony amongst rural communities. Most importantly, CBF brought about socio-economic benefits to the rural communities. In a similar vein, CBF activities are being adopted in the mountainous region of Northern Vietnam, and in reservoir coves and flood plain depressions in Lao PDR, with results complimentary to those from Sri Lanka. In all the instances, CBF activities have been sustainable with a strong community-based management strategy driving it. In all the countries, rural farming communities are adopting CBF in suitable water bodies with resulting improved income generation and food-fish availability to the rural communities.

299,The realities of community based natural resource management and biodiversity conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa,"This is an historic overview of conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa from pre-colonial times through the present. It demonstrates that Africans practiced conservation that was ignored by the colonial powers. The colonial market economy combined with the human and livestock population explosion of the 21st century are the major factors contributing to the demise of wildlife and critical habitat. Unique insight is provided into the economics of a representative safari company, something that has not been readily available to Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) practitioners. Modern attempts at sharing benefits from conservation with rural communities will fail due to the low rural resource to population ratio regardless of the model, combined with the uneven distribution of profits from safari hunting that drives most CBNRM programs, unless these ratios are changed. Low household incomes from CBNRM are unlikely to change attitudes of rural dwellers towards Western approaches to conservation. Communities must sustainably manage their natural areas as ""green factories"" for the multitude of natural resources they contain as a means of maximizing employment and thus household incomes, as well as meeting the often overlooked socio-cultural ties to wildlife and other natural resources, which may be as important as direct material benefits in assuring conservation of wildlife and its habitat. For CBNRM to be successful in the long-term, full devolution of ownership over land and natural resources must take place. In addition, as a means of relieving pressure on the rural resource base, this will require an urbanization process that creates a middleclass, as opposed to the current slums that form the majority of Africa's cities, through industrialization that transforms the unique natural resources of the subcontinent (e.g., strategic minerals, petroleum, wildlife, hardwoods, fisheries, wild medicines, agricultural products, etc.) in Africa.

300,"Critical analysis of the governance of the Sainte Luce Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA), southeast Madagascar","The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) framework is applied to critically assess the governance of the Sainte Luce Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA), southeast Madagascar. Madagascar experiences rapid population growth, widespread poverty, corruption and political instability, which hinders natural resource governance. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) has been repeatedly employed to circumvent the lack of state capacity. This includes the LMMA model, which has rapidly proliferated, represented by MIHARI, Madagascar's LMMA network. The lobster fishing is the primary source of income for households in the impoverished community of Sainte Luce, one of the key landing sites in the regional export industry. However, fishers, industry actors and available data suggest a significant decline of local and regional stocks, likely due to over-exploitation driven by poverty and migration. In 2013, SEED Madagascar a UK NGO, worked to establish community-based fishery management in Sainte Luce, setting up a local management committee, which introduced a periodic no take zone (NTZ). Despite the community's efforts and some significant achievements, the efficacy of management is limited. To date, limited state support and the lack of engagement by actors throughout the value chain have hampered effective governance. The study reinforces the finding that resilient governance relies on a diversity of actors and the incentives they collectively employ. Here and elsewhere, there is a limit to what can be achieved by bottom-up approaches in isolation. Resilient management of marine resources in Madagascar relies on improving the capacity of community, state, NGO and industry actors to collectively govern resources.

301,Interactions between finfish aquaculture and American lobster in Atlantic Canada,"Globally, lobsters are one of the most economically valuable wild species caught in capture fisheries. Catches are dominated by American lobster (Homarus americanus) landed entirely in Atlantic Canada and northeastern United States. In Atlantic Canada, lobster fishing and marine finfish aquaculture take place in the same coastal waters creating the potential for negative environmental, as well as social, interactions. We review the state of knowledge of environmental interactions between American lobster, their habitat and fishery, and marine finfish aquaculture. We first provide a brief overview of key biological, behavioural, and ecological processes and environmental stressors of American lobster at different life-history stages followed by an overview of the pathways of effects of marine finfish aquaculture on coastal ecosystems in general and on American lobster. Our review found that certain finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions have received considerable study (e.g., chemical use), whereas knowledge of other interactions are either limited (e.g., net pens, waste discharges) or lacking (e.g., disease, noise, lights, and odours). An ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture has been proposed for managing these interactions but implementing this approach has proven to be a challenge in part because of complex multi-sector, multi-stakeholder and multi-agency governance issues. While governance solutions await development, practical measures based on the results of scientific research identified in this review, such as better use of existing oceanographic and bathymetric data, habitat and human impact assessment tools, and toxicity information offer regulators ample information and management tools, at least at the farm- and bay-scale, to avoid negative finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions in Atlantic Canada. Bridging the governance gap will likely require new community-based management models that more effectively identify, generate, and integrate local community and fisher knowledge and concerns.

By analysing fisheries management in Mweru-Luapula, Zambia, I argue that this body of environmental knowledge has 1) remained largely unchanged throughout the recent shift to co-management and 2) is to a great extent based upongeneral paradigmatic conventions with regard to common property regimes. The article outlines the historical trajectories of both resource management and the political ecology ofMweru-Luapula's fishing economy. Using a relational perspective - by looking at interaction of the local fishing economy with external developments, but also by examining socioeconomic relations between individual actors - this article exposes constraints and incentives within the local fishing economy that are not absorbed in the current co-management regime. These findings challenge both policy goals and community-based resource managementitself.

303,Exploitation of the window-pane shell Placuna placenta in the Philippines,"The window-pane shell Placuna placenta or 'kapis' has great economic importance in the Philippines. The translucent shell is used in the manufacture of lampshades and other shellcraft items exported to Europe, USA and Japan. Due to its high demand, excessive and uncontrolled gathering of kapis has been noted over the past years. Its possible depletion has been a concern; thus, a nationwide survey on the status of the fishery was conducted in 1993. There are 27 kapis beds in the Philippines, six of which are considered the major sources of kapis shells. Kapis shells are gathered by (1) handpicking (in shallow areas); (2) compressor diving (in deeper areas); and (3) dredging. Because of open access to the fishery, anybody can exploit the resource. Kapis stocks are declining in most beds, while in others they are already low as a result of excessive gathering, pollution, siltation, and destructive methods of fishing such as trawling. To prevent further depletion, establishment of sanctuaries, bans on trawling and other destructive means of fishing, strict enforcement of existing regulations, community-based fishery management, and further research on seed production, restocking, and transplantation are recommended.

304,Flow of Economic Benefits From Coral Reefs in a Multi-Use Caribbean Marine Protected Area Using Network Theory,"Adaptation to changes in the delivery of ecosystem services while maintaining resilience of natural systems is one of the main challenges faced by multi-use marine protected areas (MPAs). To overcome this, it is crucial to improve our understanding of interdependencies among resource users and ecosystems. In this study we used networks to model the socio-ecological system of a multi-use MPA in the southern Caribbean. Using a mixed-method approach, we built a socio ecological network (SEN) from the flow of economic benefits that stakeholders obtain from coral reefs in Los Roques National Park. We specifically looked at how these benefits are distributed among stakeholder groups and how the structure and other network properties can inform management. For this, four networks (simple, weighted, directed and directed-weighted) were built from 125 nodes representing three services and six stakeholder groups, linked through 475 edges. The SEN structure indicated an open resource use pattern with reduced social capital, suggesting that community-based management could be challenging. Only 31% of the benefits from ecosystem services stay within the SEN. Regulation services, derived from the coral reef framework were the most important in terms of maintaining the flow of benefits through the SEN; however, most benefits depended on provisioning services. This approach, based on network theory allowed identification of inequalities in the access to benefits among groups, externalities in benefits derived from fisheries and trade-offs between provisioning and regulation services. Our results suggest that Los Roques might be falling into a socio-ecological trap. Improving access to benefits and increasing trust need be prioritized. Low-cost management intervention can help internalize financial benefits and reduce trade-offs affecting more vulnerable stakeholder groups. However, these would require changes in governance and institutions at the executive level.

306,Carotid intima media thickness and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in South Asian immigrants: Could dysfunctional HDL be the missing link?,"Introduction: South Asian immigrants (SAIs) in the US exhibit higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and its risk factors compared with other ethnic populations. Conventional CAD risk factors do not explain the excess CAD risk; therefore there is a need to identify other markers that can predict future risk of CAD in high-risk SAIs. The objective of the current study is to assess the presence of sub-clinical CAD using common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), and its association with metabolic syndrome (MS) and pro-inflammatory/dysfunctional HDL (Dys-HDL). Material and methods: A community-based study was conducted on 130 first generation SAIs aged 35-65 years. Dys-HDL was determined using the HDL inflammatory index. Analysis was completed using logistic regression and Fisher's exact test. Results: Sub-clinical CAD using CCA-IMT Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.8 mm (as a surrogate marker) was seen in 31.46%. Age and gender adjusted CCA-IMT was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes ( p = 0.008), hypertension ( p = 0.012), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( p < 0.001) and homocysteine ( p = 0.051). Both the presence of MS and Dys-HDL was significantly correlated with CCAIMT, even after age and gender adjustment. The odds of having Dys-HDL with CCA-IMT were 5 times (95% CI: 1.68, 10.78). Conclusions: There is a need to explore and understand non-traditional CAD risk factors with a special focus on Dys-HDL, knowing that SAIs have low HDL levels. This information will not only help to stratify high-risk asymptomatic SAI groups, but will also be useful from a disease management point of view.

307,Legal and institutional framework for integrated governance in a Biosphere reserve,"Wetlands provide a wide range of benefits to human communities. Better cooperation between governing bodies and human communities is essential for the optimum functioning of these wetlands and for their ongoing management. This paper aims to provide a clear understanding of the multi-level governance process by describing the management structure in the context of sustainable development, considering the main challenges arising from the co-existence of the human communities in Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (DDBR) and the administration body, namely Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority (DDBRA). We also underline the institutional and legal changes induced by the shift of government schemes over the last century. In particular, the paper outlines the link between the perceptions of different stakeholders regarding the value of this area and the investments made by the Romanian government for the development and implementation of management plans. Decision-making authority concerning DDBR management still resides with the central government. This top-down approach causes conflicts and the flexibility required to respond to local problems is lacking. At the local community level, better legal and institutional support is needed for community-based management, especially of fisheries and tourism. At the highest level, there is a need for a permanent inter-institutional coordination arrangement to deal with the harmonisation of laws and operational practices and to clarify the conflicting roles of the various government agencies concerned with DDBR management.",NA,No,"The case study in the paper is from the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, not from any of the countries specified in the screening criteria."," No; The abstract mentions a case study from the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, not from any of the listed countries.

308,Challenges to the elite exclusion-inclusion dichotomy - reconsidering elite capture in community-based natural resource management,"The community-driven, decentralised approach to natural resource management has reached a crossroads. The good governance agenda in the water, forestry, fishery and biodiversity sectors has generated limited success in achieving pro-poor outcomes. In many cases, local elites are to blame for capturing the benefits from the process of democratising decision-making processes. This paper examines two approaches in the literature which both aim to address elite domination, namely elite exclusion and elite inclusion. The former is a deliberate act to reduce the influence of elites by excluding them from the decision-making process in natural resource management. The latter, in contrast, is a conscious strategy to integrate elites into the use of natural resources in an attempt to redistribute the benefits to poor people via the 'trickle down' effect. This paper argues that the dichotomy of elite inclusion and exclusion is inadequate in understanding the complex local power dynamics in natural resource management. In particular, the binary division fails to address the multiple locations of elites, overlapping institutions and the paradoxes of 'controlled' participatory processes. This paper argues that any strategies to tackle elite capture need to pay attention to the historical, socially embedded and negotiated nature of resource governance arrangements.

309,Community-based management of near-shore fisheries in vanuatu: What works?,"In the Pacific, coastal communities have compensated for chronically low capacity of governments to manage fisheries by implementing local regulations in their marine tenure areas. In order to investigate the performance of community-based fisheries management (CBFM) in Vanuatu, trajectories and factors of change in CBFM systems since the 1990s were analysed. Focal group interviews were conducted in seven villages on EfatÃƒÂ© island in 2011 and supplemented by a review of supporting literature. Results reveal the increasing and excessive reliance of CBFM systems on external agencies that promoted overly complex management plans. Examination of trends in CBFM systems shows that community and national fishing rules that were highly acceptable by local societies were more likely to be enforced in the long run. In particular, the establishment of marine reserves was the most widespread and best enforced community rule for the purposes of conservation, ecotourism, and/or fisheries. Overall, the results challenge the current effectiveness of CBFM in achieving sustainability of reef fisheries in Vanuatu, and highlight the over-reliance on small marine reserves as a management tool. Community initiatives must be strengthened by new specific national regulations governing subsistence and commercial reef fisheries as part of a multi-scale co-management approach.

310,Patterns in artisanal coral reef fisheries revealed through local monitoring efforts,"Sustainable fisheries management is key to restoring and maintaining ecological function and benefits to people, but it requires accurate information about patterns of resource use, particularly fishing pressure. In most coral reef fisheries and other data-poor contexts, obtaining such information is challenging and remains an impediment to effective management. We developed the most comprehensive regional view of shore-based fishing effort and catch published to date, to show detailed fishing patterns from across the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). We reveal these regional patterns through fisher ""creel"" surveys conducted by local communities, state agencies, academics, and/or environmental organizations, at 18 sites, comprising > 10,000 h of monitoring across a range of habitats and human influences throughout the MHI. All creel surveys included in this study except for one were previously published in some form (peer-reviewed articles or gray literature reports). Here, we synthesize these studies to document spatial patterns in nearshore fisheries catch, effort, catch rates (i.e., catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)), and catch disposition (i.e., use of fish after catch is landed). This effort provides for a description of general regional patterns based on these location-specific studies. Line fishing was by far the dominant gear type employed. The most efficient gear (i.e., highest CPUE) was spear (0.64 kg h-1), followed closely by net (0.61 kg h-1), with CPUE for line (0.16 kg h-1) substantially lower than the other two methods. Creel surveys also documented illegal fishing activity across the studied locations, although these activities were not consistent across sites. Overall, most of the catch was not sold, but rather retained for home consumption or given away to extended family, which suggests that cultural practices and food security may be stronger drivers of fishing effort than commercial exploitation for coral reef fisheries in Hawai'i. Increased monitoring of spatial patterns in nearshore fisheries can inform targeted management, and can help communities develop a more informed understanding of the drivers of marine resource harvest and the state of the resources, in order to maintain these fisheries for food security, cultural practices, and ecological value.

311,Nitrogen removal from wastewater by coupling anammox and methane-dependent denitrification in a membrane biofilm reactor,"This work demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of nitrogen removal by using the synergy of anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) microorganisms in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR). The reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater containing nitrate and ammonium. Methane was delivered from the interior of hollow fibres in the MBfR to the biofilm that grew on the fiber's outer wall. After 24 months of operation, the system achieved a nitrate and an ammonium removal rate of about 190 mgN L -1 d-1 (or 86 mgN m-2 d-1, with m2 referring to biofilm surface area) and 60 mgN L-1 d-1 (27 mgN m-2 d-1), respectively. No nitrite accumulation was observed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that DAMO bacteria (20-30%), DAMO archaea (20-30%) and anammox bacteria (20-30%) jointly dominated the microbial community. Based on the known metabolism of these microorganisms, mass balance, and isotope studies, we hypothesize that DAMO archaea converted nitrate, both externally fed and produced by anammox, to nitrite, with methane as the electron donor. Anammox and DAMO bacteria jointly removed the nitrite produced, with ammonium and methane as the electron donor, respectively. The process could potentially be used for anaerobic nitrogen removal from wastewater streams containing ammonium and nitrate/nitrite.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the associated risk factors of stunting and wasting among children aged 6-59 months in Jima Geneti district, Western Oromia, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 500 children from December 1 to 28, 2020. A multiple-stage sampling method was performed to select children from each kebele. Anthropometric measurements were taken, and the nutritional status was generated using WHO Anthro v. 3.2.1. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS version 20.0. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify the associated risk factors of stunting and wasting among children in the study area. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The study results showed that the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children was 27% and 11.8%, respectively. The findings of this study also revealed that the prevalence of household food insecurity and poor dietary diets was 19.6% and 52.2%, respectively. Low wealth status (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 5.55) and poor dietary diets (AOR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.5, 8.83) were associated risk factors for stunting.

There is a system in place for fisheries or waterbodies, known as jalmohal administration. Under this system, the real control remains in the hands of the leaseholders. The evolution of wetland resource management approaches and their impact on actual harvesters are of particular interest in the study.

The framework of transfer of property rights, that is, leasing of wetlands as jalmohals (fishery estate), not only encourages individual gains and exploitations by the powerful elites, but also accelerates both the marginalization process and the vulnerability of local fishers to various types of shocks, including natural and health hazards.

316,Classed conservation: Socio-economic drivers of participation in marine resource management,"Conservation organizations often adopt the normative value of Ã¢â‚¬Å“whole communityÃ¢â‚¬Â participation, predicated on the idea that broad community involvement across categories of identity and social stratification will lead to more successful project outcomes. Analysis of intra-community social stratifications in relation to participation in conservation is important to the pursuit of environmental justice as well as improved efficacy of a given conservation intervention. While a large body of literature broadly examines intra and inter-community dynamics in relation to community-based conservation, few have specifically quantified how wealth influences one's participation in community-based conservation initiatives, especially in the marine realm. To address these questions, we interviewed people living near marine conservation initiatives in Madagascar. Using a principle component analysis, we created an asset-based wealth index and showed that both knowledge of and participation in marine conservation was positively correlated with wealth. Specifically, three of the four participation categories were statistically correlated with wealth, including involvement in any element of the conservation project, involvement in decision-making, and in enforcement. However, wealth was not significantly correlated with participation in monitoring. Ultimately our research highlights the importance of understanding underlying drivers of participation in community-based conservation. If the poorest in a community are underrepresented in local participation, the conservation initiative will not only be unjust, but will also likely be less effective.

317,Dietary exposure to persistent organic pollutants and metals among Inuit and Chukchi in Russian arctic Chukotka,"Objectives. The general aim was to assess dietary exposure to selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals among Eskimo (Inuit) and Chukchi of the Chukotka Peninsula of the Russian Arctic, and to establish recommendations for exposure risk reduction. Study design. A cross-sectional evaluation of nutritional patterns of coastal and inland indigenous peoples of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug (in 2001-2003); assessment of the levels of persistent toxic substances (PTSs) in traditional foods and their comparison to Russian food safety limits; the identification of local sources of food contamination; and the recommendation and implementation of risk management measures. Methods. Community-based dietary survey of self reported food frequencies (453 persons), chemical analyses (POPs and metals) of local foods and indoor matters (397 samples), substantiation of recommendations for daily (weekly, monthly) intakes of traditional food. Results. POPs in traditional food items are generally below the Russian food safety limits except marine mammal fat, while Hg and Cd are high mainly in mammal viscera. Lead is relatively low in tissues of all animals studied. For the Chukotka coastal communities, seals constitute the principal source of the whole suite of PTSs considered. Consumption restrictions are recommended for marine and freshwater fish, some wild meats (waterfowl and seal), fats (whale and seal), liver (most animals) and kidney (reindeer, walrus and seal). Evidence is presented that contamination of foodstuffs may be significantly increased during storing/ processing/cooking of food due to indoor and outdoor environmental conditions. Conclusions. Based on the analytical findings and the local PTSs sources identified, guidelines on food safety are suggested, as well as measures to reduce food contamination and domestic and local sources. Important and urgent remedial actions are recommended to minimize PTSs environmental and domestic contamination. Waste clean-up activities started in coastal Chukotka in 2007. Ã‚Â© 2012 Alexey A.

Results indicate that in contrast to other local resources, fisheries in the ejidos have less defined use rights, being viewed as largely ""open access"". In particular, most feel that outsiders can fish in an ejido if they abide by local rules (notably not damaging the local water bodies, asking consent to fish, and having a friend or relative in the community).

Therefore, it takes the smart city system to help The Government to optimize their service for citizen needs, and increasing its life quality, by putting interaction in the community based on ICT. Surabaya as a coastal city located on north coast of East Java Province make this city has several district in coastal area, one of them is Bulak District which is known as the fishing settlement integrated with tourism. Their character, totally different with midtown settlement. So do the given policy, there will be a difference treatments between coastal and midtown settlement. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the characteristic of coastal settlements that will support Surabaya as a smart city. This study aims to determine the criteria of urban settlements development in Surabaya based on smart city concept, focused on coastal urban settlement. To achieve this goal, it will use qualitative and quantitative approach (mixed method) which focuses on field conditions and community preferences in the location of settlement in the study area and must be through the 3 stage analysis. The first stage is identifying the smart potentials of coastal settlement using qualitative descriptive analysis. The second is identifying influential variables with using Confirmatory Factor Analysis feature on SmartPLS Application. The third was a determination of smart coastal settlement criteria using Pairwise comparison-triangulation. The result is there are 13 criteria of smart coastal settlement, spreaded on 6 major dimension. These criteria became a basic of dynamic measurement for smartkampung prototype which has so far resulted for identification and intelligence character on Bulak coastal settlement, included an entrepreneurship activities with local resources and uses ICT in its development; good accesibility which supported by the community's ability to follow transportation technology; ICT-based environmental management activities and community participation; creative community, open-technology-minded and able to preserve local coastal culture; sea tidal disaster free area that is equipped with mitigation facilities; developing an ICT-based tourist attraction area, and also achieving positive impact from the online Government's service.

320,"Short-term impacts and value of a periodic no take zone (NTZ) in a community-managed small-scale lobster fishery, Madagascar","The small-scale lobster fisheries of Madagascar's impoverished southeast coast account for the majority of national catch and export, making a significant contribution to the regional economy. Data suggests catches have declined, likely due to over-exploitation. In response, the community of Sainte Luce has established a locally managed marine area (LMMA) to manage their lobster fishery, including a 13 km2 periodic no take zone (NTZ). Participatory monitoring data were used to assess compliance, identify changes in catch per unit effort (CPUE) associated with the NTZ and consider the short-term value of the NTZ. Compliance is low for measures dictated by national legislation (minimum landing size (MLS), national closed season, prohibition on landing berried females), but may be higher for those designed by the community (NTZ). Upon NTZ opening in July 2015, an estimated 435% increase in catch was observed compared with the mean for the preceding five months, a product of increased effort and significantly higher CPUE. Zero Altered Negative Binomial modelling showed CPUE was significantly higher during the NTZ opening in 2015 and in 2016 when the opening period had been moved. Whilst it is unlikely that tangible ecological benefits have accrued from NTZ operation, there have been important socio-economic effects. Specifically, there was a 33% increase in the price fishers received, a significant effect at the bottom of the value chain. Temporary increases in catch and income acted as a catalyst, engaging neighbouring communities in fishery management, resulting in two additional NTZs. Attention is drawn to the fact that current national legislation may be sub-optimal and should be reviewed. Successful management of the regional fishery will require the state and industry to support communities in adopting community-based management. The NTZ measure considered here may be an effective tool to achieve this. Ã‚Â© 2017 Stephen Long.

321,In search of appropriate approaches to coastal zone management in Indonesia,"Reforms within the Indonesian political system, following the fall of the Soeharto regime in 1998, have led to some fundamental changes in the structure of government and civil administration. Two new laws, Law No. 22/1999 on Regional Government (Decentralization Law) and Law No. 25/1999 on the Fiscal Balance between the Central Government and the Regions (Fiscal Decentralization Law), which have already been revised with the enactment of laws 32/2004 and 33/2004 promote a reconsideration of community-based approaches to coastal zone management. These laws also provide new opportunities for institutionalization of local values and community institution to manage coastal resources. This paper examines community-based and co-management approaches in coastal zone management in Indonesia.

The study demonstrates that the formal prescriptions regulating Resex creation processes designed to ensure mechanisms of social participation and the protagonist role of the traditional populations fail to achieve that end. The hierarchical relationship between nature conservation interests and the rights of traditional populations, favoring the former, permeates this stage of construction and so the artisanal fishermen are not the subjects of the process.

324,A legal pluralism perspective on coastal fisheries governance in two Pacific Island countries,"In most coastal communities throughout the South Pacific customary rights to regulate access to vital and scarce resources evolved a long time ago. In many places, these systems have formed the basis of community-based marine management efforts. At the same time, national (fisheries and environmental) legislation regulates various aspects regarding the marine realm. The result is a legal pluralist situation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a circumstance that can affect the governability of coastal fisheries. This study draws on data from Fiji and Solomon Islands to examine how the national marine governance frameworks and customary/community-based marine resource management interact. Fiji has a centralized government and customary governance structures are fairly well defined. Various mechanisms exist that link the national and customary systems. In Solomon Islands customary systems and national governance authority are more dispersed and the latter is partly delegated to provincial governments. Here, partner organizations that engage in local marine management can play a vital role in bridging local and (sub-) national levels. The analysis of the two countries reveals that legal pluralist patterns can play out and be addressed differently. A deeper understanding of the interactions between national and customary marine governance systems can help to design procedures or legal mechanisms which optimize relations across levels and systems, and thus contribute to improving governance outcomes.

328,Biodiversity conservation and sustainable tourism: Philippine initiatives,"Sustainable tourism or ecotourism has been identified as one of the measures to achieve biodiversity conservation at both in situ (e.g. protected areas) and ex situ (e.g. zoos) conditions. The management strategies to harmonize biodiversity conservation and tourism development in the Philippines include the establishment of the National Integrated Protected Areas System, which incorporates tourism as a source of alternative livelihoods for local and indigenous communities living both inside and adjacent to the protected areas. The management of community-based marine protected areas has demonstrated that protecting coral reefs not only adds premium to tourist experience but also helps sustain higher fish production. The use of flagship species instills long-term public awareness about biodiversity and effectively serves as a rallying call for conservation among local residents and tourists. Zoos can take direct actions to conserve species in ex situ facilities, and these actions can be integrated in zoo tourism. The Philippine initiatives to integrate biodiversity conservation in ecotourism development are also reflected in the national tourism policy framework referred to as National Ecotourism Strategy.

329,Evaluating the fit of co-management for small-scale fisheries governance in timor-leste,"Fisheries co-management is an increasingly globalized concept, and a cornerstone of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication, adopted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization member states in 2014. Timor-Leste is a politically young country in the relatively rare position of having underexploited fisheries in some areas that can be leveraged to improve coastal livelihood outcomes and food and nutrition security. The collaborative and decentralized characteristics of co-management appeal to policymakers in Timor-Leste with provisions for co-management and customary laws applied to resource use were incorporated into state law in 2004 and again reinforced in 2012 revisions. The first fisheries co-management pilots have commenced where management arrangements have been codified through tara bandu, a process of setting local laws built around ritual practice that prohibits nominated activities under threat of spiritual and material sanctions. To date, however, there has been little critical evaluation of the suitability or potential effectiveness of co-management or tara bandu in the Timor-Leste fisheries context. To address this gap, we adapted the interactive governance framework to review the ecological, social and governance characteristics of Timor-Leste's fisheries to explore whether co-management offers a valid and viable resource governance model. We present two co-management case studies and examine how they were established, who was involved, the local institutional structures, and the fisheries governance challenges they sought to address. Despite their relative proximity, the two sites contrasted in local ecology and fishery type; community institutions were starkly different but equally strong; and one site had tangible economic benefits to justify compliance, where the other had marginal and anecdotal fishery gains. In our review of the broader governance landscape in Timor-Leste, we see co-management as a useful mechanism to govern small-scale fisheries, but there is a need to connect legitimized local institutions with hierarchical governance of higher and external influences. Initial successes with implementing tara bandu incorporating a small marine closure have stimulated other communities to implement no-take zones - one universally popular but very limited interpretation of co-management. However, we highlight the need for a set of guiding principles to ensure legitimate community engagement, and avoid external appropriation that may reinforce marginalization of certain user groups or customary power hierarchies.

330,Developing a framework for evaluating tallgrass prairie reconstruction methods and management,"The thousands of hectares of prairie reconstructed each year in the tallgrass prairie biome can provide a valuable resource for evaluation of seed mixes, planting methods, and post-planting management if methods used and resulting characteristics of the prairies are recorded and compiled in a publicly accessible database. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of such data to understand the outcomes of reconstructions over a 10-year period at two U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges. Variables included number of species planted, seed source (combine-harvest or combine-harvest plus hand-collected), fire history, and planting method and season. In 2015 we surveyed vegetation on 81 reconstructions and calculated proportion of planted species observed; introduced species richness; native species richness, evenness and diversity; and mean coefficient of conservatism. We conducted exploratory analyses to learn how implied communities based on seed mix compared with observed vegetation; which seeding or management variables were influential in the outcome of the reconstructions; and consistency of responses between the two refuges. Insights from this analysis include: 1) proportion of planted species observed in 2015 declined as planted richness increased, but lack of data on seeding rate per species limited conclusions about value of added species; 2) differing responses to seeding and management between the two refuges suggest the importance of geographic variability that could be addressed using a public database; and 3) variables such as fire history are difficult to quantify consistently and should be carefully evaluated in the context of a public data repository.

331,Increased income from seasonally flooded rice fields through community based fish culture in Bangladesh and Vietnam,"In extensive river floodplains and deltaic lowlands, floods lasting several months render the land unavailable for crop (often rice) production during the rainy season. Aside from crop production during the flood-free dry season, the land area can be utilized for fish production during the flood season. This can be done by enclosing parts of these floodwater areas to produce a crop of stocked fish aside from the naturally occurring wild species. The WorldFish Center and its national partners recently tested (1) concurrent rice-fish culture in the shallower flooded areas and (2) alternating rice and fish culture in the deep-flooded areas of Bangladesh and Vietnam through a community-based management system. This paper presents the key results of this work, focusing on the economics of existing land use patters and the impact of community based fish culture on rice yields and income. Rice production was maintained, or even enhanced. Fish production was increased beyond the wild catch by about 600 kg/ha/year in shallow-flooded areas and up to 1.5 t/ha/year in deep-flooded areas, without reduction in wild fish catch. For the overall system on an annual basis, an additional income ranging from US$ 135 per hectare in southern Vietnam to US$ 437 per hectare in Bangladesh was achieved, which is an increase of 20 to 85 percent over the profitability of the previous systems involving cropping and fish capture.

Statistical analysis used: rates, ratio, proportion, univariate and multivariate analysis. Results MetS was 47.6% (1606 of 3372 screened) and mean age 47.1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 10.9 years. Univariate analysis showed educational status, occupation, family history of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco and alcohol consumption, financial stress, depression, less physical activity, more consumption of meat, fish, egg, diary products, and high-energy food significantly associated with MetS. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, education, occupation, computer owner (OR: 3.69, CI: 2.10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6.47, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.000), family history of diabetes (OR: 3.18, CI: 2.10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6.47, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.000), stress (OR: 1.85, CI: 1.45Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.35, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.000), consuming dairy product Ã¢â€°Â¥3 times/week (OR: 2.57, CI: 1.68Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3.94, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.000) and nuts and oilseed <3 times/week (OR: 2.37, CI: 1.90Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.96, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.000) have significant association.

333,Local ecological knowledge and the management of marine protected areas in Brazil,"This manuscript discusses the role of fishers' Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) in the management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken at nine MPAs to investigate MPA managers' (n = 9) and higher governmental level authorities' (n = 5) perceptions on these. Varying levels of MPA governance approaches were assessed, from government-led centralized top-down (e.g. marine biological reserves) to community-based bottom-up MPA categories (e.g. marine extractive reserves). The use of fishers' LEK was found to be an essential means of achieving a broader and more diverse knowledge basis for MPA management, though most of the management current in place is still science-driven in Brazil. The full engagement of local knowledge can also be regarded as a means of empowering local communities and promoting responsibility, but only if a more inclusive praxis of participation is put to work. Different meanings for 'Local Knowledge Use' in MPA management were outlined and described for different management approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up). It was noted that each of these meanings brings different outcomes in terms of stakeholder participation and empowerment. It is also suggested that MPA co-management schemes might benefit from the adoption of a 'knowledge-building' instead of 'knowledge-using' approach during a 'problem-solving' instead of 'decision-making' management process. Finally, it is concluded that it will be an enormous challenge to put LEK to work in the benefit of MPAs in the country amidst so many priority actions brought by the problems affecting the Brazilian National System of MPAs. Government must open up the agenda to deliberatively discuss the roles of local knowledge in MPA management, whilst local communities organise themselves and increase the demand for participation with responsibility.

334,"A co-designed, transdisciplinary adaptive management framework for artisanal fisheries of Pehuen Co and Monte Hermoso (Argentina)","The artisanal fishers from the Pehuen Co and Monte Hermoso (Argentina) are aiming for sustainable use of the common pool resource of their socio-ecological system (SES). However, complex interactions between the artisanal fishers and other actors (the industrial fisheries, natural reserve managers, fish traders, conservationists and governance authorities) are putting the fishing activity at risk. An adaptive management plan has been developed to analyse this SES based on the results of combining the analysis-orientated Systems Approach Framework with the action- oriented multi-Driver-Pressure-System-Impact-Response framework. The overarching issue is the sustainability of the fishery, although there are a number of sub-issues affecting the fishing activities including: restricted access to the sea, damage to the seabed integrity, fishing legislation, distribution of the product, and conflict of conservation with fishing. The most important pressures are overfishing and bottom damage, resulting in habitat deterioration and depletion of the stock. The main impacts on human welfare are the loss of income, the loss of jobs and the loss of biodiversity. A transdisciplinary management plan has been formulated based on common responses to these impacts, such as the organisation of the fishers into local associations, and the creation of a fishing terminal through the synergy of the community with researchers and the governance authorities. The long-term objective is to promote community based management of the natural resources of Pehuen Co and Monte Hermoso.

336,Customary marine tenure systems and sustainable fisheries management in Papua New Guinea,"Takes a critical look at a current model of fisheries management which is based on principles related to Hardin's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tragedy of the CommonsÃ¢â‚¬Â. According to this model, where access to a fishery is free, it is not in the interest of the community to limit their fishing effort. To prevent over-fishing and eventual destruction of fish stocks, fisheries managers in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have concentrated their efforts on imposing limits on fishing effort. Argues that such methods are bound to fail because they are imposed by outsiders and are alien to the local communities. Argues that customary marine tenure systems have a better chance of success in the management of local fisheries resources because they are community-based and are derived from kinship and lineage structures.

337,"Resilient salmon, resilient fisheries for British Columbia, Canada","Salmon are inherently resilient species. However, this resiliency has been undermined in British Columbia by a century of centralized, command-and-control management focused initially on maximizing yield and, more recently, on economic efficiency. Community and cultural resiliency have also been undermined, especially by the recent emphasis on economic efficiency, which has concentrated access in the hands of a few and has disenfranchised fishery-dependent communities. Recent declines in both salmon stocks and salmon prices have revealed the systemic failure of the current management system. If salmon and their fisheries are to become viable again, radically new management policies are needed. For the salmon species, the emphasis must shift from maximizing yield to restoring resilience; for salmon fisheries, the emphasis must shift from maximizing economic efficiency to maximizing community and cultural resilience. For the species, an approach is needed that integrates harvest management, habitat management, and habitat enhancement to sustain and enhance resilience. This is best achieved by giving fishing and aboriginal communities greater responsibility and authority to manage the fisheries on which they depend. Co-management arrangements that involve cooperative ownership of major multistock resources like the Fraser River and Skeena River fisheries and community-based quota management of smaller fisheries provide ways to put species conservation much more directly in the hands of the communities most dependent on the well-being and resilience of these fisheries.

338,"Benefits and challenges of scaling up expansion of marine protected area networks in the Verde Island Passage, Central Philippines","Locally-established marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proven to achieve localscale fisheries and conservation objectives. However, since many of these MPAs were not designed to form ecologically-connected networks, their contributions to broader-scale goals such as complementarity and connectivity can be limited. In contrast, integrated networks of MPAs designed with systematic conservation planning are assumed to be more effective-ecologically, socially, and economically-than collections of locally-established MPAs. There is, however, little empirical evidence that clearly demonstrates the supposed advantages of systematic MPA networks. A key reason is the poor record of implementation of systematic plans attributable to lack of local buy-in. An intermediate scenario for the expansion of MPAs is scaling up of local decisions, whereby locally-driven MPA initiatives are coordinated through collaborative partnerships among local governments and their communities. Coordination has the potential to extend the benefits of individual MPAs and perhaps to approach the potential benefits offered by systematic MPA networks. We evaluated the benefits of scaling up local MPAs to form networks by simulating seven expansion scenarios for MPAs in the Verde Island Passage, central Philippines. The scenarios were: uncoordinated community-based establishment of MPAs; two scenarios reflecting different levels of coordinated MPA expansion through collaborative partnerships; and four scenarios guided by systematic conservation planning with different contexts for governance. For each scenario, we measured benefits through time in terms of achievement of objectives for representation of marine habitats. We found that: in any governance context, systematic networks were more efficient than non-systematic ones; systematic networks were more efficient in broader governance contexts; and, contrary to expectations but with caveats, the uncoordinated scenario was slightly more efficient than the coordinated scenarios. Overall, however, coordinated MPA networks have the potential to be more efficient than the uncoordinated ones, especially when coordinated planning uses systematic methods.

339,A communication framework for climatic risk and enhanced green growth in the eastern coast of Ghana,"Progresses made in global responses to climate change shows that adaptation is gradually finding its way into development planning, yet delays are generally expected from competing priorities of several sectors, policy and knowledge challenges. To understand these dynamics, a pathway for enhanced climatic risk communication, which is a form of a non-structural adaptation, was analyzed in Ghana's coastal zones. Two learning platforms, the Community-based Risk Screening Tool for Adaptation and Livelihoods (CRiSTAL), and U-Learning (Theory U-Process) were used to engage the state level policy-making process in governing development within coastal zones in the face of increased climatic risks and climate change impacts. Local livelihood priorities showed that a national level development planning framework that excluded local contexts of climatic risks face possible maladaptation. Subsequently the process that was engaged in the local contextualization of climatic risks and development in selected Districts culminated in the consensus framework, Coastal Zone Green Growth (CZGG), informed mostly by concerns over clean energy usage and ecologically compatible use of coastal resources. Therefore the CZGG potentially provides co-benefits for enhanced ecosystem services, livelihoods and adaptation. Thus, it constitutes a denominator for measuring climatic risks and adaptation to potentially inform the policy-making process towards sustainable coastal zone management practices. Except for the desired goals of CZGG being far reaching and futuristic, they overlapped with goals of the adaptation strategies of the local population, which are similar to development goals. Therefore communicating localized contexts of coastal climatic risks of which sea level rise is seen often as remote to planning, could strengthen risk management in integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and enhance resilience of vulnerable communities. However, this will require the designation of a body which is accustomed to the local issues to facilitate, harmonize and coordinate multi-sector actions and diverse stakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ interests for the CZGG to become a reality in contributing to ICZM in Ghana.

340,Association of Transforming Growth Factor ÃŽÂ² Polymorphism C-509T With Radiation-Induced Fibrosis Among Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: Whether genetic factors can identify patients at risk for radiation-induced fibrosis remains unconfirmed. Objective: To assess the association between the C-509T variant allele in the promoter region of TGFB1 and breast fibrosis 3 years after radiotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is an a priori-specified, prospective, cohort study nested in an open-label, randomized clinical trial, which was conducted in community-based and academic cancer centers to compare hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (WBI) (42.56 Gy in 16 fractions) with conventionally fractionated WBI (50 Gy in 25 fractions) after breast-conserving surgery. In total, 287 women 40 years or older with pathologically confirmed stage 0 to IIA breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery were enrolled from February 2011 to February 2014. Patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years. Outcomes were compared using the 1-sided Fisher exact test and multivariable logistic regression. Exposures: A C-to-T single-nucleotide polymorphism at position -509 relative to the first major transcription start site (C-509T) of the TGFB1 gene. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was grade 2 or higher breast fibrosis as assessed using the Late Effects Normal Tissue/Subjective, Objective, Medical Management, Analytic scale (range, 0 to 3) three years after radiotherapy. Results: Among 287 women enrolled in the trial, TGFB1 genotype and 3-year radiotherapy-induced toxicity data were available for 174 patients, of whom 89 patients (51%) with a mean (SD) age of 60 (8) years had at least 1 copy of C-509T. Grade 2 or higher breast fibrosis was present in 12 of 87 patients with C-509T (13.8%) compared with 3 of 80 patients without the allele variant (3.8%) (absolute difference, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.7%-18.4%; P =.02). The results of multivariable analyses indicated that only C-509T (odds ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 1.25-15.99; P =.02) and postoperative cosmetic outcome (odds ratio, 7.09; 95% CI, 2.41-20.90; P <.001) were significantly associated with breast fibrosis risk. Conclusions and Relevance: To date, this study seems to be the first prospective validation of a genomic marker for radiation fibrosis. The C-509T allele in TGFB1 is a key determinant of breast fibrosis risk. Assessing TGFB1 genotype may facilitate a more personalized approach to locoregional treatment decisions in breast cancer.

The island is the site of a community-based fishery resources management project of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center Aquaculture Department, funded by the International Development Research Centre of Canada.Using a case study approach and inferential statistics in the analysis of data, the CD. management arrangements on the island are perceived to be successful based on equity, efficiency and sustainability criteria.

Potential problems nonetheless, still exist with the ambivalent attitude of fishers toward rule-breaking, especially of fishery rules directly affecting them. The future of co-management arrangements will largely depend on how the fishers and other stakeholders maintain and build earlier initiatives with the eventual phasing out of SEAFDEC AQD from the island.

345,Nudging statutory law to make space for customary processes and community-based fisheries management in Solomon Islands,"Like many Pacific countries, Solomon Islands has more than one legal system operating concurrently: customary law, statutory law and the common law of England. Governance also occurs at national, provincial and local scales. Local people managing coastal and marine resources under customary marine tenure (CMT) have increasing difficulties in enforcement as external threats exceed their scope of governance. Before 2015, CMT breaches were not a fisheries violation as recognised by the western legal system. Drawing on our involvement in developing a new Fisheries Management Bill in 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2015 and consultations within the Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources, we examine how, and to what effect, the resultant ActÃ¢â‚¬â€specifically Section 18 on Community Fisheries Management Plans (CFMPs)Ã¢â‚¬â€has accommodated or shifted the relationship between customary governance systems and the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contemporary fisheries legislation. We examine if, and how, employing Section 18 can contribute to regional and global fisheries governance policy implementation. The Fisheries Management Act 2015 recognises the rights of customary rights holders to institute CFMPs, provides a mechanism to codify and enforce access and use rights through CMT and empowers these efforts as a legitimate management tool under statutory law. We conclude that statutory law has been Ã¢â‚¬ËœnudgedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to make space for the dynamic process of customary law. We contend that use of Section 18 has the potential to elevate community voices in discussions of coastal and marine resource management at different scales, if practitioners do not lose sight of the intent behind the statuteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development.

347,Quantitative decision support tools facilitate social-ecological alignment in community-based marine protected area design,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used to support both biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. However, MPA performance is likely to be compromised if people who depend on fishing are excluded from MPA design decision making. Participatory MPA design helps to address this problem by engaging local stakeholders in all critical decisions, including the total coverage, placement, and local size of no-take marine reserves. Here, we report the findings from a participatory MPA design project on Selayar Island, Indonesia, in which a community initiated collaborations with scientists to access modern quantitative tools for community-led MPA scenario testing. The outcomes highlight a local disagreement between ecologically and socially desirable MPA designs. Focused on social considerations, the initial community-supported MPA design consisted of four small reserves (0.5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1 km wide) in predominately southern community waters, where they were intended to restrict external fishers. Ecologically optimal MPA designs, in contrast, consisted of one or two large reserves (4Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6 km wide) in northern community waters, where they were expected to restrict primarily local fishers but better support the rebuilding of fish populations and fisheries. However, ecologically optimal MPA designs were socially infeasible. Using quantitative MPA performance assessments, the community negotiated an alternative MPA design consisting of two 1.5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2 km wide reserves at socially and ecologically favorable locations. Compared to the initial proposal, this revised MPA design was estimated (1) to protect three to four times more individuals of key fishery species within reserve boundaries and (2) to double local fishery catches. We conclude that even simple MPA design tools, which quantify and visualize local conservation and fishery outcomes under alternative MPA scenarios, add value to participatory decision making and likely MPA performance.

348,Tolerance for the Florida panther in exurban southwest Florida,"Human tolerance for negative interactions with the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) is an important component of panther conservation efforts. ResidentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tolerance for interactions with Florida panthers in exurban areas has not been explicitly studied, even though the highest number of documented human-panther interactions has occurred in a single exurban community in Florida (i.e., Golden Gate Estates). We implemented a mail-based survey in Golden Gate Estates in 2015 to investigate community membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ level of tolerance for the panther. Golden Gate Estates provides a case study for future conservation efforts as panthers recolonize their historical range, and the panther comes into contact with more exurban and residential communities. Based on regression analysis of survey data, we found that individuals with eco-centric value orientations, individuals who were aware of panthersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ presence in Florida prior to moving to Golden Gate Estates, and individuals who believe that proper animal care protects domestic animals from panthers were more tolerant of the panther. Age, livestock ownership, panther depredation of domestic animals, and risk concern were significant negative determinants of panther tolerance.

349,Marketing systems of freshwater prawns in three coastal districts of Bangladesh,"The present study analyzes the prawn marketing chain before and after the implementation of a Danish-funded project (GNAEP) in three coastal districts of greater Noakhali, southeast region of Bangladesh. The results reveal that, before GNAEP, there was a longer prawn marketing chain with a number of intermediaries who used to share a considerable amount of market margin. However, after implementation of GNAEP, the prawn marketing chain has become shorter with a significant reduction of intermediaries which facilitates direct selling of prawns to processing plants through local Community Based Organizations (CBOs). The present prawn marketing system in the regions is in favor of prawn farmers. Farmers have greater advantages because 1) CBOs provide reasonable market price and actual weight, 2) CBOs can bargain with processing plants as the former are aware of the latest international market prices through Marketing Information System 3) number of intermediaries is lowered and 4) transport and preservation costs are reduced.

350,Community-based monitoring of small-scale fisheries with digital devices in Brazilian Amazon,"Fisheries management is potentially a short-term measure for reducing floodplain fisheries degradation. This objective can only be achieved if adequate measures to improve fishery governance and ecosystem conservation are taken. The monitoring of fisheries management is likely to be important for understanding the effectiveness of local rules and the impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Given that monitoring is the periodic assessment of fish stock characteristics regarding reference data, adopting tools and procedures for monitoring at different scales is a challenging task. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have enabled local communities to gather data on key resources in a cost-effective way. This article presents a community-based monitoring of fisheries based of smartphones that supports the annual fishing quotas and legal harvest permits procedures. The precision of community-based monitoring data is assessed and a model to integrate these data into a large-scale monitoring scheme examined. Data collection performance was evaluated at communities in the KaxinawÃƒÂ¡ Nova Olinda Indigenous Territory, in the State of Acre, where fishery management was monitored. The results indicate that voluntary collectors are able to provide data with precision comparable with government agency measurements, but at lower cost.

351,Enhancing the participation of small-scale fishing sector in decision-making: Good practices from Atlantic in EU,"The aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the degree of participation and influence of Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF) across the European Union Atlantic Area putting forward a set of good practices and recommendations for policymakers, Non-Governmental Organisations and SSF representatives. The actual margin for enhancing the degree of influence of SSF on decision-making processes is still large. Moving towards community-based management models from the current hierarchical models is compulsory. A set of measures have been adopted in Western Waters following participatory processes, introducing self-management and co-management tools at the local and regional levels. This research goes beyond the governance model addressing issues such as the increase of influence when the final decision-makers promote a certain devolution of power to the local/regional levels carried out in parallel with reinforcing the capacity of the SSF representatives to exercise such power.

352,Conditions for sustainability of small-scale fisheries in developing countries,"Institutions that manage small-scale fisheries across the globe can be locally based, state controlled or of a mixed, cross-scale nature. The latter arrangement, widely known as co-management, is generally believed to be the preferred approach for sustainability. This paper employs a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA) to examine 17 cases of small-scale fisheries in developing countries, in order to assess the degree of state involvement which may be most effective in realizing sustainable small-scale fisheries. These degrees vary between: (a) strong top-down regulation irrespective of fishing community wishes, (b) a co-management mode of negotiation with fishing communities, (c) a merely supportive role of the state, or absence from the fishing scene. It was revealed that contrary to expectations, the sustainability of small-scale fisheries depended solely on the strength of collective social capital of the local communities at the resource scale. With weak local social capital, degrees of government involvement did not make any difference; the fisheries were unsustainable in all cases. The prime role for governments in small-scale fisheries in developing countries therefore seems to be as intelligently absent as possible, by way of respecting, protecting, and supporting local institutions.

In eastern India too several fish farming groups have been organised, who have been given lease of community tanks for productive use. In the present study an attempt is made to evaluate the socio-economic impact of CBA. Factors responsible for the success of CBA and constraints to management of CBA were also identified. Data were collected from Puri (Orissa) and Purulia (West Bengal) through case study. Involvement in aquaculture has had positive impact on raising income level and social status of the members. However, community participation was observed to be moderate and the level of participation of women was low. A number of factors determine the success of CBA. Important among these are - homogeneous social status of members, people's institution, good leadership, external agency as catalyst etc. Infrastructural factors e.g., market and extension support also found to influence CBA.

355,Land management policy in the coastal area based on the local wisdom,"Most land ownership, land utilization, and the general use of land in several coastal areas in Indonesia are regulated under customary law and local wisdom. Unluckily, some of the Agrarian Laws issued by the government regulating the ownership and utilization of lands often are not in concomitance with the local wisdom. This study discusses the status and compatibility between customary law and formal agrarian law in Maluku, Bali-Lombok, Aceh, and Riau Islands through normative juridical methods. The results show that the coastal management in the current study sites has a relatively identical scheme with a slight difference in terminology. The management and utilization of coastal areas in Maluku Province are regulated by community-based fishery management known as Sasi. While in Aceh, they named it Panglima Laot, a customary institution that mediates local fishers and the government and assists local governments in the successful development of fisheries, customs, and habits of fishing communities. Similarly, Bali-Lombok comes with their term known as Awig-awig, while Batam is proud of their Kelong. Local wisdom for coastal management was ignored by the government before the 1998 reformation. Fortunately, time changed, and the government gave more authority to local governments to adopt local wisdom and apply customary laws. This study proves that harmonization between state laws and customary laws can be configured by understanding each interest, mission, and target for a better environment and society's livelihood.

356,"Drought conditions and recovery in the Coorong wetland, south Australia in 1997-2013","Between 2004 and 2009, South Australia suffered its longest period of below average annual rainfall. This impacted riverine ecosystems and particularly the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), the largest river system in Australia. The MDB combines 30,000 wetlands of which the Coorong wetland is of significant importance for the reproduction of bird and fish species, and is listed under the Ramsar Convention. We sampled water in the Coorong wetland between 2011 and 2013 and compiled additional data from 1997 to 2013 to assess the impact of the drought and subsequent recovery of the environment. The salinity levels of the Coorong wetland increased dramatically during the drought because of the lack of freshwater inflow from the Murray River. The changes in water flow observed from 2002 to 2009 had an impact on the number of habitats present along the Coorong wetland. In addition, a shift in community composition was observed between the freshwater habitat (<5) dominated by chlorophytes to the hypersaline habitat (>85) dominated by diatoms. It is evident that during the drought, the Coorong wetland was dominated by diatoms and dinoflagellates. After the drought, the North Lagoon was dominated by chlorophytes up to a salinity level of 20. However, over 20 and in the South Lagoon, diatoms dominated the community. This study highlights how salinity levels drive the phytoplankton community. Based on the complementary data obtained for salinity between 1997 and 2010, there is a significant difference between the salinity levels observed during the drought and those observed before and after the drought. It appears that salinity levels are now recovered to what they were in the late 1990s.

357,Untangling Tales of Tropical Sardines: Local Knowledge From Fisheries in Timor-Leste,"Tropical sardines (Family Clupeidae) are an important component of many marine fisheries in the Indo-West Pacific region. In Timor-Leste, a small, less-developed country within this region, Ã¢â‚¬ËœsardiÃƒÂ±aÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are some of the more commonly caught and consumed fish. Yet there is little published information from Timor-Leste about the species composition of these fisheries, nor their biology or ecology. We document the knowledge of Timorese fishers on nine locally distinguished sardine types that contribute to fisheries, and relate these to at least nine species: four species of Ã¢â‚¬ËœFlat-bodied SardinellasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Sardinella subg. Clupeonia spp.), one species of Ã¢â‚¬ËœRound-bodied SardinellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Sardinella subg. Sardinella lemuru), two species of Ã¢â‚¬ËœTropical PilchardsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Amblygaster spp.) and a Ã¢â‚¬ËœTropical HerringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ species (Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus), all from the Clupeidae family; and one Dussumieria species from the Dussumieriidae family. We record variations in local sardine names across the country and document aspects of fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ knowledge relevant to understanding and managing the fisheries, including local sardine speciesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ seasonality, habitat, movements, interannual variation, as well as post-harvest characteristics in relation to perishability. In general, local names relate more closely with groups of species than individual species, although some names also distinguish fish size within species-groups. The local knowledge identified in this study has immediate application to inform fisheries monitoring and management, and to identify areas for future research. Notably, Timorese fishers recognize and make use of the strong association between some sardine species-groups and seasonally turbid river plumes. While further research is required to understand the underlying mechanisms of this association, this emphasizes the need to consider coastal fisheries and fisher livelihood impacts when assessing any plans or proposals that may alter river flow or water quality. Fishers also recognize migratory behavior of some sardine species, in particular the Flat bodied Sardinellas (S. gibbosa and others) along the north-west coast of Timor-Leste and across the border into Indonesian West Timor. Such insights complicate and need to be accounted for in initiatives for co-management or community-based management of Timor-LesteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coastal waters and their fisheries.

358,Impact of the Community-based Fish Culture System on Expenditure and Inequality: Evidence from Bangladesh,"This study investigated the impact of a Community-based Fish Culture (CBFC) system on household expenditure and how expenditure inequality in the fish-producing communities has changed due to involvement in the CBFC system. Six floodplains, comprising three project sites and three controls, were chosen from three river basin areas of Bangladesh; data for this study were collected for a period of 3 yr. A propensity score matching method was used to evaluate the impact of CBFC on household expenditure; while a Gini coefficient and Gini decomposition were used to estimate inequality. The results show that the CBFC system has a positive and significant impact on fish culture community household expenditure. Results also reveal that the CBFC system has an equalization effect on food, clothing, and healthcare expenditure. Furthermore, this management system helps to distribute total expenditure 15% more equally among the fish culture communities.

361,Developing fish community based ecohydrological indicators for water resources management in Taiwan,"With concerns about the maintenance of both aquatic communities and flow conditions, a number of hydrologic indicators have been developed. These indicators are generally based on the development of hydrologic statistics for flows that are important to the maintenance of aquatic ecosystems. Although the hydrologic basis for indicators is well defined by common techniques in stochastic hydrology, the basis for ecological integration is still being developed. A critical evaluation of hydrologic indicators intended to protect aquatic ecosystems finds that proposed indicators are based more on standard hydrologic statistics and measures of hydrologic alteration than the habitat needs and ecological requirements of local or desired aquatic communities. We argue that hydrologic indicators are not ecohydrological indicators unless direct connections between flow events and aquatic community habitat and ecological needs are the basis of the indicator development and selection. In this article, we identify ecohydrological indicators that are based on habitat and ecological needs of fish communities. The indicator identification process is initiated with the analysis of community needs using an autecology matrix. Hydrologic statistics are then selected that are appropriate to the target fish community. The resulting ecohydrological indicators provide a direct connection to fish community flow requirements and the physical habitat conditions and associated ecology and life history needs of fish species.

362,"Influence of social, management and enforcement factors on the long-term ecological effects of marine sanctuaries","Marine sanctuaries are increasingly being promoted as tools for conservation and fisheries management. This study investigates the effects of protection over 19 years on substrate composition and fish communities in four marine sanctuaries and corresponding non-sanctuary areas in the Philippines and examines the importance of community support, management measures and enforcement of regulations on these ecological effects. Between 1981 and 2000, substrate cover variables were measured using line transects with scuba and snorkel surveys, and fish censuses (identification to family level) were conducted using scuba within a 500 m2 area. Semi-structured interviews collected data on community support for the sanctuaries, and observations and interviews established management and enforcement aspects of the sanctuaries. Over time, all sanctuaries showed improvements, or maintenance of, ecological variables compared with pre-enforcement times, with maintenance of hard coral cover and average increases of 8.3% in fish species richness and 54.9% in fish abundance. In comparison, non-sanctuary areas showed maintenance of the status quo or declines in ecological variables. However hard coral cover, fish abundances and fish species richness showed significant declines as well as increases in sanctuary areas. Community, management and enforcement factors were significantly related to positive ecological trends in sanctuary areas; management and enforcement were related to a wider variety of ecological factors than community score. Community support was significantly related to an increase in hard coral cover in deep areas. Enforcement of regulations was significantly related to an increase in abundance of fishery target fish species in sanctuary areas, and simple management measures were significantly related to an increase in abundance of large predators. Supportive communities that voluntarily implemented sanctuary regulations, improved enforcement, and small discrete cohesive communities may have facilitated the process of building this community support. Well-enforced sanctuaries that showed an increase in abundance of target species may have contributed to the maintenance of fish yields in adjacent non-sanctuary areas. The effects of sanctuary implementation varied on a case-by-case basis, influenced by environmental, biological, physical and human factors. However, a combination of community support, management measures and enforcement of regulations contributed towards positive ecological trends in sanctuary areas.",NA,No,"The study was conducted in the Philippines, not in any of the countries listed in the SC."," No; The abstract mentions that the study was conducted in the Philippines, not in any of the countries listed in the SC.

363,Crisis and conservation at the end of the world: Sheep ranching in Argentine Patagonia,"Patagonia was one of the last regions in the Americas to be settled by Europeans. It was not until the mid-1880s that the Argentine government secured effective control over the region, after which settlement, and economic development were based on sheep ranching. Virtually free of domesticated animals in 1885, by 1910 Patagonian rangelands supported some 12 million sheep. This growth was sustained until 1952, when the sheep population of the region peaked at approximately 22 million, but the number of sheep in Patagonia has since declined to about 13 million. Numerous factors have been implicated in the collapse of sheep ranching, one of great significance being the very poor state of Patagonian rangelands. Soil erosion is widespread, and the flora has been so heavily modified that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine what the composition and characteristics of Patagonia's pre-European vegetation were. This paper reviews the evolution of Patagonia's sheep industry and the nature and extent of environmental degradation caused by livestock. Although researchers have long called for a response to the environmental and socio-economic dimensions of the crisis, only in the past decade have initiatives to assess, monitor, and reverse degradation in Patagonia been launched. These initiatives often promote the diversification of land-use and alternative production strategies. Case study evidence from the upper Percey River watershed in western Chubut province indicates that ranchers may view alternative livelihoods with suspicion. It is suggested that measures to restore and protect Patagonian ecosystems would gain greater acceptance if local producers were seen as equals in the conservation and development process. This could be achieved by replacing more-traditional top-down models of policy design and implementation with measures based on genuine consultation and participatory, community-based approaches to natural resource management.",NA,No,"The paper's case study is from Argentine Patagonia, not from any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is focused on a case study from Argentine Patagonia, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

364,Towards local governance of marine resources and ecosystems on Easter Island,"Social-ecological system sustainability depends in part upon the fit between ecosystems and institutions. In 2014, the local community on Easter Island started a bottom-up process to improve marine resources conservation and management. Local stakeholders formed a working group that has regular meetings and goals, such as creating a sea council and some basic action plans, thus initiating a local governance transformation process. A participatory process was conducted together with a local organization that led the marine conservation issues on the island to define the factors that could favour and/or undermine the formation of the sea council. Also, the stakeholders that must be present in such a sea council were identified. Twelve factors that could facilitate or hinder the implementation of a sea council were identified. The lack of representativeness of public institutions is a major challenge. Public institutions are designed to ensure compliance with central government strategies, but the decisions do not represent the worldview of islanders. The results showed the potential value of conducting a participatory process to identify the key issues that could hinder or favour a desired governance transformation process. The participatory process also highlighted governance mismatches that are important to consider in attempts to pursue more effective fishery governance on Easter Island, and other Island communities. Centralized governance systems do not respond rapidly to locally observed social and ecological dynamics. By contrast, a local decision-making system based on traditional laws and local governance can more rapidly respond to observed changes. The participatory process presented here holds the potential to support local people in their planning and coordination for marine conservation and management in order to optimize bottom-up change processes involving multiple stakeholders with different interests, values and levels of power.

365,"Marine protected area strategies: Issues, divergences and the search for middle ground","There has been a dramatic increase in recent years in the number of papers, reports, etc., which have been published concerning Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This overview of the objectives, selection, design and management of MPAs aims to provide a basis for discussion regarding possible ways forward by identifying emerging issues, convergences and divergences. Whilst the attributes of the marine environment may limit the effectiveness of sitespecific initiatives such as MPAs, it is argued that it would be defeatist in the extreme to abandon MPAs in the face of these limitations. Ten key objectives for MPAs are discussed, including that of harvest refugia, and it is argued that whilst these objectives may be justifiable from a preservationist perspective, they may be objected to from a resource exploitation perspective. MPAs generate both internal (between uses) and basic (between use and conservation) conflicts, and it is argued that these conflicts may be exacerbated when scientific arguments for MPAs are motivated by preservationist concerns. It is reported that a minority of MPAs are achieving their management objectives, and that for the majority insufficient information was available for such effectiveness evaluations. Structure and process-oriented perspective on marine conservation are discussed. It is argued that there are two divergent stances concerning optimal MPA management approaches: top-down, characterized as being government-led and science-based, with a greater emphasis on set-aside; and bottom-up, characterized as being community-based and science-guided, with a greater emphasis on multiple-use. Given the divergent values of different stakeholders, the high degree of scientific uncertainty, and the high marine resource management decision stakes, it is concluded that a key challenge is to adopt a ""middle-ground"" approach which combines top-down and bottom-up approaches, and which is consistent with the post-normal scientific approach.",NA,No,The abstract does not provide any information suggesting a case study from the specified countries.," No; The abstract does not mention any specific location or case study, let alone one from the listed countries.

367,Community-based fisheries organisations and sustainable development: Lessons learned from a comparison between European and Asian countries,"Small-scale fisheries (SSF) provide livelihoods for millions of people, contribute to global food security and economic development, and are considered a less aggressive type of fishing activity. Therefore, SSF can significantly contribute to sustainable development, particularly in areas related to the sea and marine resources.

From this perspective, this paper discusses different aspects of the contribution of community-based fisheries organisations (CBFOs) to sustainable development in SSF. To do this, a comparative analysis was carried out for several European, Southeast Asian and South Asian countries, in contexts with institutional, historical and environmental diversity.

368,Management of inland open water fisheries resources of Bangladesh: Issues and options,"Despite the possession of a highly productive inland water area of about 45,000 km2, the continuing decrease in fish catch increasingly threatens the livelihoods of more than 12 million fishers in Bangladesh. The government's open access and leasing policies have been identified as the principal causes of catch decline. Conflicting demands on the inland aquatic area also accelerate drastically the destruction of aquatic resources. Barriers to the access of fishers in the management of inland fisheries resources and over-exploitation by the relatively wealthier non-fisher population are reducing the options for sustaining the livelihoods of fishery dependent communities. The government has pursued a range of initiatives to arrest this continued decline but none has appeared to be appropriate.

369,"Social and economic challenges to community-based sea cucumber mariculture development in new Ireland province, Papua New Guinea","This article describes the outcomes of research into the potential of community-based mariculture of the commercial sea cucumber, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), as a sustainable livelihood in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Around 5000 cultured juvenile sandfish were stocked in a 5-ha trial community sea ranch. The community agreed to protect the area from fishing until researchers collected technical data on sandfish performance. However, poaching of sandfish from the trial sea ranch occurred during the 2018 annual sea cucumber fishing season and no technical data were generated. Community attitudes and responses to the fishing season, the mariculture research activity and the failure of the trial sea ranch were investigated. Widespread community approval of the trial sea ranch and respect for the fishing prohibition were reported. However, it was found that poaching within the ranch escalated to extensive fishing because community-based management proved inadequate to sanction the poachers. Increased buying pressure and higher prices led to intensified fishing effort in the 2018 season. The trial sea ranch failed due to external pressures (i.e., brief, intense fishing season; limited project capacity), compounded by internal factors (i.e., weak local leadership; community disunity). It was concluded that research into and development of sandfish mariculture as a livelihood option in New Ireland Province might be impossible at this time due to the high value of sandfish, the annual sea cucumber fishing season, and ineffective governance at community, provincial and national levels. Lessons learned from this experience are presented and alternative models discussed.

371,"Regional differences of the community-based management of spiny lobster gillnet fisheries in kushimoto-cho, the southernmost of Kii Peninsula","Coastal fisheries management in Japan is considered to be one of the most successful community-based management (CBM) systems worldwide. Local communities in micro-scale areas, which previously had fishery cooperatives, have long conducted well-established CBM of coastal fisheries based on common fishery rights derived from historical local community customs. Among those CBM systems, the one governing spiny lobster (.Panulirus japonicus) gillnet fisheries is a representative strategy for common fishery rights. However, less analysis has been conducted on the micro-scale differences in the CBM strategies of coastal fisheries. This study therefore explored the diversity of micro-scale CBM of spiny lobster gillnet fisheries and the factors causing diversification. The study site was Kushimoto-cho, located at the southernmost tip of the Kii Peninsula, Japan. Eleven areas under the jurisdiction of the large-scale Wakatama-Higashi Fishery Cooperative in Kushimoto-cho were analyzed. First the fishing characteristics of cach area were identified by collecting and analyzing fishing sales slips. As a result, although the fishing characteristics were clearly diverse, some geographic fishing patterns, primarily in response to environmental conditions within the fishing grounds, were detected. Next, the CBM methods for spiny lobster gillnet fisheries were categorized into the spatial, temporal, gear/method, and entry-level management types. Finally, the CBM strategics in each area were compared for cach category. The contents and implementation of the CBM methods for spiny lobster gillnet fisheries showed different characteristics among the 11 areas. Six main factors that affected those differing characteristics were identified: 1) environmental and ecological status: 2) fishing population: 3) generation; 4) coping with external actors: 5) organization and its capabilities: and 6) relationships among the areas based on the joint use of fishing grounds. Consequently, it was clarified that the CBM diversification between the micro-scale areas proceeded through the accumulation of the responses of fishery household groups to social and ecological factors and their fluctuations. Fishery household groups had multiple intentions to establish and continue the CBM system for diverse reasons, not only to arrange their fishing activities and to protect resources, which were often assumed to be the dominant purpose of CBM arrangements in previous studies. In some cases. CBM was undertaken to foster cooperation among fishery households, ensure the benefits from catching spiny lobsters, or organize conventional fishing activities. The CBM diversification strategy was also affected by those varying intentions because they strongly affected fishermen's decisions when elements of the CBM system were subject to change.",NA,No,The study does not involve a case study from any of the listed countries.," No; The study is based in Japan, not any of the listed countries.

372,"Outcomes of the ""BRCA Quality Improvement Dissemination Program"": An initiative to improve patient receipt of cancer genetics services at five health systems","Objective: A quality improvement initiative (QII) was conducted with five community-based health systems' oncology care centers (sites AÃ¢â‚¬â€œE). The QII aimed to increase referrals, genetic counseling (GC), and germline genetic testing (GT) for patients with ovarian cancer (OC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods: QII activities occurred at sites over several years, all concluding by December 2020. Medical records of patients with OC and TNBC were reviewed, and rates of referral, GC, and GT of patients diagnosed during the 2 years before the QII were compared to those diagnosed during the QII. Outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics, two-sample t-test, chi-squared/Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression. Results: For patients with OC, improvement was observed in the rate of referral (from 70% to 79%), GC (from 44% to 61%), GT (from 54% to 62%) and decreased time from diagnosis to GC and GT. For patients with TNBC, increased rates of referral (from 90% to 92%), GC (from 68% to 72%) and GT (81% to 86%) were observed. Effective interventions streamlined GC scheduling and standardized referral processes. Conclusion: A multi-year QII increased patient referral and uptake of recommended genetics services across five unique community-based oncology care settings.

We surveyed landowners and watershed council members in the South Santiam watershed in Oregon to determine which information sources citizens found useful and trustworthy to provide information about watershed management. Our findings indicate that many landowners had little experience with information providers in the region. Personal experience was by far the most useful source of information. The most trusted information providers were the university Extension Service, university scientists, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Oregon Department of Forestry.

374,Revenue Sharing and Social Capital in Community-Based Resource Management: Empirical Evidence from Japanese Surf-Clam Fisheries,"This article provides the first rigorous analysis of the effects of revenue sharing and social capital and identifies the mechanism through which revenue sharing and social capital affect resource outcomes. Revenue sharing alters harvest incentives but also fosters social capital through bonding a group financially, which can affect the incentive for cooperation. Similarly, social capital counteracts the incentive to free-ride induced by revenue sharing in addition to sustaining the incentive to cooperate. Using data collected from Japanese fishery groups, we find evidence that revenue sharing improves economic outcomes primarily through incentivizing fishers to develop their information networks.

375,Community-based mangrove forest management: Implications for local livelihoods and coastal resource conservation along the Volta estuary catchment area of Ghana,"Even though global interest in mangrove research has increased in recent years, unveiling their immense ecological and economic roles, very little work has been done to investigate the primary driving factors motivating long-term community-based mangrove restoration and management on local scales. In Ghana, policy makers and coastal management practitioners have recently embraced the concept of community-based and co-management of coastal and marine resources. Community-based and co-management approaches require that key stakeholders, most notably the resource users themselves, play significant roles and responsibilities in the management process. However, there is little evaluation of the process in Ghana to assess the success or otherwise, particularly of the few and long standing examples of community-based approaches in coastal resource management. With special reference to an over two decade old community-based mangrove forestry programme along the Volta estuary of Ghana, this paper provides concepts for examination of the ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing mangrove restoration and management by fishers, fish mongers, farmers and their socioeconomic groupings. Participatory GIS mapping and the use of orthophotos generated for the period 1974-2011 provided additional information on temporal evolution of the extent of mangrove areas restored and managed by local stakeholders. Socioeconomic assessment of mangrove products utility was done through questionnaire interviews. The results indicate that livelihoods and economic benefits are the primary factors that motivate local stakeholders' participation in mangrove restoration and management. Mangroves provisioning services, markets and low livelihoods diversification are major drivers of mangrove resources exploitation. The study has shown that mangroves resources can be sustainably exploited, restored and managed if local customary rules are enforced and institutional arrangements put in place to mediate mangrove exploitation and regeneration rates. Such an approach if well developed, could promote coastal resources conservation with high economic returns for the users.

376,"Making a case for community-based oyster restoration: An example from Hampton Roads, Virginia, U.S.A.","The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) remains at historically low levels throughout the Chesapeake Bay. Recent efforts to restore oysters in the bay have focused on establishing a series of sanctuaries, or no-take zones, to increase oyster broodstock in selected tributaries. Oyster parasites continue to affect the rate of recovery in these tributaries; however, innovative management strategies, advances in aquaculture technology, and the availability of disease-tolerant broodstock from the lower Chesapeake Bay are providing ways to involve the public directly in restoration of this resource. A 1996 management decision to transplant large wild-caught oysters onto an oyster broodstock sanctuary reef in the Great Wicomico River, Virginia, was followed by greatly increased abundance of juvenile oysters throughout that river in 1997. Using that result as a model for strategic oyster reef restoration, citizens and school students have been enlisted to grow large numbers of hatchery-produced native oysters for restocking other sanctuary reefs throughout Chesapeake Bay. Efforts to supplement natural oyster populations in Hampton Roads, Virginia, began in May 1998, with the transplanting of 65,000 hatchery-produced oysters grown by school students. The oysters were transplanted onto strategically located sanctuary reefs constructed in the Lynnhaven and Elizabeth rivers. Surveys of these reefs following the oysters' spawning season have revealed order-of-magnitude increases in the abundance of juvenile oysters on both reefs, and correspondingly high spat settlement rates on oyster grounds surrounding the reefs. These results demonstrate that stocking strategically located broodstock reefs with hatchery-produced oysters grown by citizens can be an effective strategy for oyster restoration in the Chesapeake Bay.",NA,No,The case study in the paper is from a location not listed in the SC.," No; The paper is based on a case study from Hampton Roads, Virginia, U.S.A., not any of the listed Pacific Island countries.

378,Rehearsing Inclusive Participation Through Fishery Stakeholder Workshops in the Philippines,"Participatory methods in 'conservation for development' projects regularly fail to live up to expectations of social and environmental change. Stakeholder workshops are an ubiquitous example that can reproduce rather than challenge inequality and exclusion. Technical tools used in workshops, like maps, games, and computer models, are criticised for unjustly privileging expert/scientific viewpoints over other perspectives. Iris Marion Young's theory of communicative democracy is an insightful and robust framework to examine how people interact in the workshop 'contact zone', and how to bring workshops closer to participatory ideals. Young identifies four communication modes critical for inclusive participation: greeting, rhetoric, narrative, and argument. We apply her framework to a case study of fisheries stakeholder workshops in the Philippines, demonstrating its utility and cultural applicability. The workshops used a game-based computer modelling tool to structure discussions about coastal management. Qualitative analysis of video data shows how stakeholders signalled resistance, garnered sympathy, influenced outcomes, and established relationships through Young's modes of communication. Based on this analysis, and using concepts from Philippine psychology, we conclude that workshops have potential as 'rehearsal spaces' for inclusive deliberation, particularly when they encourage improvisation and humour, rather than rote adherence to standardised activities.

379,Comparing five methods for quantifying abundance and diversity of fish assemblages in seagrass habitat,"Seagrass fishes perform key ecological roles and are a critical component of many of the world's fisheries. A sound understanding of seagrass fish communities, based on robust methods, is therefore integral for their successful environmental management and conservation. Here we quantitatively compare taxa and size class of seagrass fish assemblages collected using; baited and unbaited remote underwater video (BRUV, URUV), diver operated video (DOV), underwater visual census (UVC) and trawling. We assess comparisons of these methods in terms of biodiversity indicators and power to detect change. All five methods were deployed in coastal embayments dominated by Posidonia spp. and within three marine parks along the south-western coast of Western Australia. Fish assemblages recorded using the different methods separated into two distinct groups; those dominated by smaller and less motile species, that are typically present beneath the canopy among seagrass leaves; and those dominated by larger, faster swimming species present above the seagrass canopy. Trawling provided the most effective method for assessing species within the canopy, including those of conservation concern. Conversely, BRUV followed by URUV recorded the greatest number of individuals, successfully detecting the larger supra-canopy and highly motile species typically omitted by trawling. Both trawl and BRUV methods had a higher power to detect change in species richness of seagrass fishes compared to other methods, even though each method recorded different components of the fish assemblage. Fish assemblages recorded using UVC detected both inter and supra-canopy species, but fish abundances recorded by this method were low compared to trawl and BRUV surveys, resulting in reduced power to detect change in richness. DOV was a comparatively less effective method, recording few fish, as well as low richness and diversity values. The combination of trawling and stationary video techniques, particularly BRUV, provided a two-method combination able to holistically measure commonly used indicators of fish assemblage composition in seagrass habitat. These results demonstrate that careful consideration of the methodology is essential when assessing ichthyofauna in seagrass habitat, particularly when only a single method can be employed. As the extent of methodological influence on recording fish assemblages also varied among the three survey areas, geographical differences in the structure of fish and seagrass communities should be considered when selecting an appropriate sampling method.

380,Results of a community based disease monitoring program of marine mammals in Arctic Canada,"It is the right of Canadian Inuit to hunt marine mammals for subsistence. Most of this food is consumed raw, yet it under goes no formal government inspection or certification. Hunters also encounter sick or abnormal animals and they are becoming increasingly concerned about the wholesomeness of the food that they eat. They are also concerned about epizootics that may severely limit the number of animals that are available for their use. As a result, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has been asked by Inuit wildlife management groups to determine what possible disease threats are present in the marine mammal populations of Arctic Canada. Two separate DFO surveillance projects have been operational since the mid 1990's to address those concerns. The first uses tissue samples supplied from hunter-killed and presumably healthy animals while the second encourages hunters to submit tissue samples from animals that appear either sick or abnormal or that are found dead. Both programs rely on the co-operation of a number of specialists and the results of these investigations have provided a rare insight to the role that infectious diseases are having on the overall health of marine mammals in Arctic Canada. Specifically, serological evidence of significant viral and bacterial pathogens including distemper, influenza A, herpes and brucellosis has been obtained from the apparently healthy animals while patterns of natural mortality are emerging from the systematic testing of the sick/abnormal submissions. Of special concern is the role that infectious diseases such as brucellosis may be having on stocks of animals that are classed as endangered. Brucellosis in these animals may proceed as a steady decline in numbers over time while the introduction of a highly pathogenic viral disease such as distemper into a population of immunologically naÃƒÂ¯ve animals may be immediately catastrophic.

381,Restricted grouper reproductive migrations support community-based management,"Conservation commonly requires trade-offs between social and ecological goals. For tropical small-scale fisheries, spatial scales of socially appropriate management are generally smallÃ¢â‚¬â€ the median no-take locally managed marine area (LMMA) area throughout the Pacific is less than 1km2. This is of particular concern for large coral reef fishes, such as many species of grouper, which migrate to aggregations to spawn. Current data suggest that the catchment areas (i.e. total area from which individuals are drawn) of such aggregations are at spatial scales that preclude effective community-basedmanagement with no-take LMMAs.We used acoustic telemetry and tag-returns to examine reproductive migrations and catchment areas of the grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus at a spawning aggregation in Papua New Guinea. Protection of the resultant catchment area of approximately 16km2 using a no-take LMMA is socially untenable here and throughout much of the Pacific region. However, we found that spawning migrations were skewed towards shorter distances. Consequently, expanding the current 0.2km2 no-take LMMA to 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2km2 would protect approximately 30Ã¢â‚¬â€œ50% of the spawning population throughout the nonspawning season. Contrasting with current knowledge, our results demonstrate that species with moderate reproductive migrations can be managed at scales congruous with spatially restricted management tools.

382,Community-based management of the environment: Lessons from the past and options for the future,"1. Traditional community-based systems of managing coastal fisheries were (or in some cases are) successful in managing resources at sustainable levels. These systems are used as models in the present study. 2. They were (or are) under-pinned by a sense of ownership and intimate knowledge of the environment in local people. 3. Such features have been largely lost, as subsistence economies have been replaced by capitalist ones, and environmental management responsibilities have shifted from local communities to national or international government. 4. There are, nevertheless, some examples of community-based management systems that still operate successfully and we believe that modern management practices, in general, would benefit from increased community involvement. This will require renewed emphases on feelings of ownership and increased knowledge of the environment in the general public. 5. Environmental education will have a fundamental role to play in achieving this goal. However, its impact in schools and universities has been disappointingly ineffective so far in promoting a population that is sufficiently knowledgeable and well-motivated to partake meaningfully in environmental management processes. 6. It is argued that educational initiatives, which involve all ages and sections of society, are required. Five promising possibilities are: (i) the participation of community groups in scientific projects; (ii) increased emphasis on life-long learning; (iii) educational campaigns; (iv) citizens' juries; and (v) the involvement of community groups in environmental planning and management processes. 7. Wide-scale adoption of innovations of these kinds will require funding and this will be achieved only by national re-assessments of educational needs and priorities.

Drawing on an analysis of over 50 consultative workshops and meetings, held from 2018 to 2021 during the PGEM revision, we document the materials, discourses, and practices local stakeholders (e.g., fishers, cultural and environmental activists, government staff, and scientists) combine to build their interpretations of PGEM success or failure.

384,River fisheries management in Bangladesh: Drawing lessons from Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) experiences,"River fisheries in Bangladesh is characterized as ""open-access"" and the history of administrative and legislative measures bear ""contradiction and dilemmas"" in resource extraction. The 1950 Fisheries act, the proclamation of 1973 that restricted lease to the registered fisher cooperatives and the experimental New Fisheries Management Policy (NFMP) of 1986 could not contribute to devolve into any participatory institution to introduce sustainable fisheries management. Because of the persistent dilemma in government policy, continued increase in fishing pressure and other anthropogenic reasons, the River resources degraded substantially. Over the past ten years, the Department of Fisheries (DOF) in collaboration with NGOs implemented community based fisheries management (CBFM) approaches with the technical assistance from the WorldFish Center. The principal goal of the approaches was to provide access rights to the fishers through organizing poor fishers and the community to introduce sustainable fisheries management in beels, floodplains and River sections. The CBFM experiences suggest that management and institution building process in river management is complex, and require participation of all concerned stakeholders including local government institutions and administration. CBFM-2 river fisheries management developed a broad-based institutional framework that include community and local government along with the direct beneficiaries and resource users. A positive feature of such institutions is its ability to facilitate flow of information among agents, which is a key to maintain solidarity within and across groups.

385,"Perceptions of gender dynamics in small-scale fisheries and conservation areas in the Pursat province of Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia","The Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, supporting millions of small-scale fisher livelihoods. Women's contributions in these fisheries are often overlooked due to socio-cultural expectations of roles and responsibilities. This is a crucial omission since climate and anthropogenic influences increasingly threaten lake inhabitants. Addressing these challenges requires the full participation of both men and women who use the lake, thus it is necessary to first understand the social dynamics of these communities. We investigated whether there were differences between men's and women's perceptions of (i) fishing and non-fishing practices; (ii) power, access and control over fishing resources; and (iii) perceptions towards conservation and conservation areas in Pursat, Cambodia. We interviewed fishers and key informants, and found differences in perceptions of fishing and non-fishing practices between fishermen and fisherwomen. Men more openly acknowledged unequal power dynamics, access to and control over fishing resources when compared with women. We found contrasting ideas of community fisheries and conservation between men and women, and health and safety challenges they faced in conservation areas. Findings suggest that community perspectives and unequal power relations established specific roles for women that limited their active participation in fisheries management.

A number of innovative policy initiatives are currently being implemented in New Zealand to enable indigenous Maori tribes and sub-tribes to rehabilitate and manage their local fisheries in accordance with customary values and practices. These policies are an important milestone from an historical perspective as they are meant to recognise and empower the role of Maori as Treaty partners. The fisheries management regime in New Zealand now provides for Maori representation at the local level within a co-management framework that enables local Maori communities to exercise their customary rights. These institutional arrangements have been crafted to facilitate Maori input, based on customary values and practices, to complement modern Western management practices for sustainable harvesting of marine resources. Nevertheless, the degree to which these initiatives constitute an adequate response to Maori Treaty aspirations is debatable.

387,"Impact of a local, coastal community based management regime when defining marine protected areas: Empirical results from a study in okinawa, Japan","There is a growing impetus to increase marine protected areas coverage globally from 6% to 30% in 2030. Successfully establishing and maintaining marine protected areas require incorporating public preferences into their establishment and management. We investigate the role of alternate management regimes (top-down and bottom-up) on preferences for marine protected areas and the marginal rate of substitution between natural and manmade capital using a case study in the Asia-Pacific region of Okinawa, Japan. We implemented a choice experiment survey to infer which attributes of marine protected areas are most important for the respondents. We use our survey results to calculate respondents' willingness to support marine protected areas in Okinawa. This study contributes to the policy debate on management of marine protected areas with empirical data that characterizes the perception of Okinawan residents with respect to the role of local coastal communities (bottom-up) compared to central government based agencies (top-down) management. We extend the analysis and estimate the trade-offs to residents in Okinawa between natural capital (i.e. coral coverage and marine biodiversity attribute) and man-made capital (i.e. restrictions on coastal development). We find that the underlying management regime affects the local residents' valuation of the marine protected area with residents showing a higher willingness to support bottom-up management regimes. There is also substantial differences in the willingness to support different characteristics of marine protected areas by management type. Finally, we find that the marginal rate of substitution between natural capital and man-made capital varies by management type such that residents would need to be compensated relatively less in terms of man-made capital in the presence of a policy scenario that proposes an increase in natural capital under a bottom-up management regime.

388,Locally-managed marine areas: Multiple objectives and diverse strategies,"Community-based management and co-management are mainstream approaches to marine conservation and sustainable resource management. In the tropical Pacific, these approaches have proliferated through locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs). LMMAs have garnered support because of their adaptability to different contexts and focus on locally identified objectives, negotiated and implemented by stakeholders. While LMMA managers may be knowledgeable about their specific sites, broader understanding of objectives, management actions and outcomes of local management efforts remain limited. We interviewed 50 practitioners from the tropical Pacific and identified eight overarching objectives for LMMA establishment and implementation: (1) enhancing long-term sustainability of resource use; (2) increasing short-term harvesting efficiency; (3) restoring biodiversity and ecosystems; (4) maintaining or restoring breeding biomass of fish or invertebrates; (5) enhancing the economy and livelihoods; (6) reinforcing customs; (7) asserting access and tenure rights; and (8) empowering communities. We reviewed outcomes for single or multiple objectives from published studies of LMMAs and go on to highlight synergies and trade-offs among objectives. The management actions or 'tools' implemented for particular objectives broadly included: permanent closures; periodically-harvested closures; restrictions on gear, access or species; livelihood diversification strategies; and participatory and engagement processes. Although LMMAs are numerous and proliferating, we found relatively few cases in the tropical Pacific that adequately described how objectives and management tools were negotiated, reported the tools implemented, or empirically tested outcomes and seldom within a regional context.

389,Effectiveness of shore-based remote camera monitoring for quantifying recreational fisher compliance in marine conservation areas,"Marine conservation areas require high levels of compliance to meet conservation objectives, yet little research has assessed compliance quantitatively, especially for recreational fishers. Recreational fishers take 12% of global annual fish catches. With millions of people fishing from small boats, this fishing sector is hard to monitor, making accurate quantification of non-compliance an urgent research priority. Shore-based remote camera monitoring was tested for quantifying recreational non-compliance in near-shore, coastal rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) in the Salish Sea, Canada. Six high definition trail cameras were used to monitor 42 locations between July and August 2014. Seventy-nine percent of monitored conservation area sites showed confirmed or probable fishing activity, with no significant difference in fishing effort inside and outside RCAs. Mixed effects generalized linear models were used to test environmental and geographic factors influencing compliance. Sites with greater depth had significantly higher fishing effort, which may imply high, barotrauma-induced, rockfish mortality in RCA sites. Non-compliance estimates were similar to aerial fly-over compliance data from 2011, suggesting that trail camera monitoring may be an accurate and affordable alternative method of assessing non-compliance in coastal conservation areas, especially for community-based organizations wishing to monitor local waters. Widespread non-compliance could compromise the ability of RCAs to protect and rebuild rockfish populations. Increased education, signage, and enforcement is likely to improve compliance.

The EPI cluster sampling technique was adapted for this purpose. The sample size, including the number of clusters and the number of units per cluster, was increased to permit stratification of the data and comparison of the results with those obtained in a study conducted prior to the introduction of the outreach services in 1988. At the time of the survey interview, 67% of the children were fully vaccinated (78% against measles) and by 1 year of age, 58% were fully vaccinated (69% against measles). The increase in coverage since the introduction of the programme was statistically significant only for measles (Student's t-test, P < 0.01). A total of 75% of children living in formal dwellings, compared with 51% living in informal dwellings, were fully vaccinated by interview (Fisher's exact test, two tailed, P < 0.0001).

391,Community management by decree? Lessons from Cambodia's fisheries reform,"The Cambodian government introduced a dramatic reform in 2001 that reduced the allocation of commercial fishing lots in favor of local community access. Hailed by community activists, the policy shift nevertheless accelerated a crisis in the sector, with effectively open access and very poor law enforcement leading to intense exploitation and a surge in illegal fishing. This essay reviews the context and the content of the reform initiative, the preliminary outcomes and many challenges faced in its implementation, and the lessons for other developing countries aiming to support community-based management in fisheries or other natural resource sectors. Building the organizational capacity of community institutions, I argue, is inadequate if not complemented by efforts to improve governance by establishing appropriate legal authorities and rights, strengthening the accountability of public officials, and removing barriers to the economic viability of community management.

393,Linking community and national park development: A case from the Dominican Republic,"National parks have complex relationships with local communities that impact both conservation success and community well-being. Integrated conservation and development projects have been a key approach to managing these relationships, although their effectiveness has been increasingly questioned. Park-people relationships of the Armando Bermudez National Park in the Dominican Republic were studied, focusing on forests, aquatic resources, community well-being and development, and ecotourism. The park, established in 1956, is well respected by the community, based on its long history and its role in protecting water resources that are critical to the community. However, management of riparian vegetation and local fisheries present challenges in terms of finding a balance between conservation and development. Hiking and trekking opportunities attract both national and international tourists to the park, and community members benefit from employment as tour guides and providing mule rentals. At the same time, tourism activities also present continuing challenges related to: (1) the distribution of tourism benefits between local people and outsiders, and within the local community, (2) maintaining the local economic benefits of tourism while protecting park resources, and (3) developing park- or conservation-related economic opportunities to complement tourism.

394,Integrated assessment of ecosystem health using multiple indicator species,"Healthy river ecosystems can provide fundamental ecological services for human survival and social development. However, previous studies that have sought to assess river ecosystem health have primarily focused on individual biological communities rather than on all aquatic communities and have been based on a single-index assessment method, thereby leading to large uncertainties in the results. In this study, we developed a new framework for the integrated assessment of aquatic ecosystem health based on the principal communities of fish, zoobenthos, phytoplankton, and zooplankton in rivers. An index of biotic integrity was used to evaluate the health of fish and zoobenthos communities, and a diversity index was used to evaluate the health of zooplankton and phytoplankton communities. To integrate the health assessment results from these four communities, a quantile normalization method was developed, where uncertainties in assessments obtained using the diversity index were well compensated for by the assessments obtained using the biotic integrity index. The framework was then applied to a pilot city, which is being constructed as a civilized freshwater ecological city in China. The results were then compared with those previously obtained based on the single-community method. Using this new framework, we found that the aquatic ecosystem health changed regularly in space and over time. Large differences were detected among the assessments of the four individual communities based on the single-community method, with the health score determined using phytoplankton being the highest, followed by that of zoobenthos, zooplankton, and fish, which made it difficult to reach a definitive conclusion regarding aquatic health status. The integrated assessment framework presented in this study successfully overcame the narrow perspective of the single-community method, thereby reducing uncertainties in the assessments based only on a single diversity index, and instead provides a comprehensive view of the status of aquatic ecosystem health. Thus, this integrated framework could assist river managers and stakeholders in developing comprehensive strategies for ecological restoration and water resource management and could become a key research tool for the health assessment and rehabilitation of aquatic ecosystems globally.

395,Swanp forest restoration in Haor area for livelihood security - A community based approach,"About 50% of areas of Bangladesh are wetlands, which provide about 80% animal protein. Wetlands viz. river, canal, haor, baor, beel, floodplains, lake and coastal estuaries are the repository of the fish and other aquatic resources. As an agricultural economic based country, about 75% rural people are dependent on wetlands resources. Wetlands provide livelihood security in the form of a food, household materials, fodder for cattle and kitchen fuel. Socio-cultural events are also based on the nature and seasonal variation of wetlands. Apart from these, wetlands are also supporting navigation across the country. Wetlands swamps were the habitats for innumerable species of flora and fauna. Mainly extension of agriculture and dwellings for increasing population, unwise and excessive construction of roads and dams, industrialization and rapid urbanization play significant roles for degradation and conversion of wetlands. The existing management, i.e., leasing system of the haor from the government is allowing the lessee to over-exploit the resources and restrict the resource bases from the access of local villagers. People of the haor areas are thus facing a tremendous crisis against the availability of fish, fuel wood, housing and thatching materials. Homesteads and even the villages are in increasing vulnerability by the increased wave erosion during the monsoon since natural barrier of wave action, i.e., swamp forests, are degraded. Community based wetlands resource management projects have been commenced for the restoration of haor ecosystem. Community participation has been ensured during development of the action plan of Pagnar and Sanuar-Dakuar haor. Selection of indigenous aquatic plant species, development of management plan and benefit sharing mechanism have been delineated in the participatory action plan development workshop. Already vanished and degraded swamp forests have been restored through plantation and allowing natural succession on the kanda (raised land in the vast haor) in the project area. Priority areas have been identified based on ecological potential and community interest for plantation. About 250 thousands of aquatic plants such as hizal (Barringtonia acutangula), karoch (Pongamia pinnata) and Barun (Crataeva magna) have been planted in 80 ha of degraded area. In addition, locally vulnerable swamp reeds have been planted in some parts of the haor to foster the restoration process. Community interests and consensus are privileged in the whole process of restoration despite their inherent benefits for enhancing the daily livelihood. Restored swamp forest will contribute to promoting the habitats for biodiversity as well as support for the enhancement of the livelihood security of rural haor people.

396,Conserving fish stocks in an inland aquatic ecosystem: The effect of community based fisheries management in Bangladesh,"Fishable species abundance through conservation measures for enhancing fish populations by the participation of local fishing communities has been established in Ashurar Beel of northwest Bangladesh. A government led partnership, the Community Based Fisheries Management project, has been introduced to organize and motivate fishers towards the understanding and implementation of fisheries management practices. Fisher groups from 25 villages with 527 members are included in the project. An institution connecting the organized groups, the Beel Management Committee, ensures fisher rights. A fish sanctuary has been established by fishers for the residence of brood fish and to develop guidelines to limit fishing in the fishery. Tremendous production of fish from the beel has been achieved. Major changes were observed in catches, species compositions and the contribution of species to total production. Most of the catch is small fishes, particularly Puntius sophore. An abundance of Ompok pabda, Channa striatus, Channa punctatus, Aorichthys seenghala, Gudusia chapra, Anabas testudineus, and Notopterus notopterus has indicated the successful recovery of these threatened fishes.

It utilizes field-based, mixed research methods, drawing primarily on quantitative survey data, supplemented with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, personal communications with villagers, and participant observation from AugustÃ¢â‚¬â€œDecember 2013. Research results indicate that use of dead mangrove wood for fuelwood is the most important extractive use of mangroves within the Delta. Fish, clam, oyster, and shrimp collection is the second most important use of mangroves in the region. Senegal's Forest Code Law notwithstanding, ambiguity remains in mangrove management and adequate means are lacking for protection of mangroves within the Delta. Study results show that mangrove reforestation is a robust activity in the region, and that financial incentives from international organizations and NGOs are significant in motivating community involvement.

398,Effects of the Developing and Using a Model to Predict Dengue Risk Villages Based on Subdistrict Administrative Organization in Southern Thailand,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of developing and using a model to predict dengue risk in villages and of a larval indices surveillance system for 2372 households in 10 Thai villages. A community participatory action research method was used in five steps: (1) community preparation covering all stakeholders, (2) assessment of the understanding of a dengue solution and a larval indices surveillance system, (3) development of a prediction and intervention model for dengue risk villages, (4) implementation of the model that responds to all stakeholders, and (5) evaluation of the effects of using the model. The questionnaires to assess and evaluate were validated and reliability tested. The chi-square test and FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact test were used to analyze the quantitative data collected by means of questionnaires. Thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data collected through interviews. The results found that the model consisted of six main activities, including (1) setting team leader responsibility, (2) situation assessment, (3) prediction of the dengue risk in villages, (4) the six steps of the larval indices surveillance system, (5) the understanding of the dengue solution and the understanding of the larval indices surveillance system training program, and (6) local wisdom innovation. The effects of using the model showed a statistically significant increase in correct understanding among 932 family leaders, 109 village health volunteers, and 59 student leaders regarding dengue prevention and control (p < 0.05). The larval indices and dengue morbidity were diminished and related to the nine themes present in the community leadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reflections and to the satisfaction of the community members.

399,Integrated coastal management and marine protected areas: Complementarity in the Philippines,"Small marine protected areas (MPAs) were established in the Philippines as early as 1974. These models set forth a framework for coral reef management that has been shown to enhance fish yields to traditional fishers as well as protect and maintain near-shore coral reef habitats for biodiversity and multiple economic uses. The history of MPAs is described in relation to the evolution of integrated coastal management (ICM) in the Philippines. Devolution of authority for management of natural resources to local governments in 1991 was a major national policy shift that has supported more localized management efforts. This policy shift has encouraged more MPAs but not a higher rate of success. As the numbers of MPAs increased, the need for a support base beyond the MPA has become apparent. A convergence of MPAs within ICM programs was seen by 2000. Numerous experiments in coastal management have thus been conducted that range from broad area management planning for whole bays to small community-based MPA projects. Important lessons with implications for broader-based support systems required by MPAs within ICM, include: The importance of a well-articulated process that includes community participation and ownership in collaboration with single or multi-municipal governments; the role of multiple stakeholders, government and donor agencies in planning and management; the creative use of financial mechanisms to create long-term self-supporting MPAs; the need for localized periodic monitoring and evaluation to provide feedback to managers, and the need for nesting of MPAs within ICM through broad area planning and implementation.

400,Seahorses in focus: Local ecological knowledge of seahorse-watching operators in a tropical estuary,"Background: Seahorses are endangered teleost fishes under increasing human pressures worldwide. In Brazil, marine conservationists and policy-makers are thus often skeptical about the viability of sustainable human-seahorse interactions. This study focuses on local ecological knowledge on seahorses and the implications of their non-lethal touristic use by a coastal community in northeastern Brazil. Community-based seahorse-watching activities have been carried out in MaracaÃƒÂ­pe village since 1999, but remained uninvestigated until the present study. Our goal is to provide ethnoecological understanding on this non-extractive use to support seahorse conservation and management. Methods: We interviewed 32 informants through semi-structured questionnaires to assess their socioeconomic profile, their knowledge on seahorse natural history traits, human uses, threats and abundance trends. Results: Seahorse-watching has high socioeconomic relevance, being the primary income source for all respondents. Interviewees elicited a body of knowledge on seahorse biology largely consistent with up-to-date research literature. Most informants (65.5 %) perceived no change in seahorse abundance. Their empirical knowledge often surpassed scientific reports, i.e. through remarks on trophic ecology; reproductive aspects, such as, behavior and breeding season; spatial and temporal distribution, suggesting seahorse migration related to environmental parameters. Conclusions: Seahorse-watching operators were aware of seahorse biological and ecological aspects. Despite the gaps remaining on biological data about certain seahorse traits, the respondents provided reliable information on all questions, adding ethnoecological remarks not yet assessed by conventional scientific surveys. We provide novel ethnobiological insight on non-extractive modes of human-seahorse interaction, eliciting environmental policies to integrate seahorse conservation with local ecological knowledge and innovative ideas for seahorse sustainable use.

402,"Participatory ecosystem service mapping to enhance community-based mangrove rehabilitation and management in Demak, Indonesia","Assessment of mangrove ecosystem services (ES) is essential to understand and manage the contribution of these ecosystems to the well-being of local communities. They are the primary beneficiaries but their experience, knowledge, and information are frequently ignored in ES assessment and mapping. In this study, a participatory resource mapping (PRM) approach was applied using local knowledge and experience to analyze geo-referenced information on mangrove ecosystem services. Local communities were involved from the beginning in method selection, application, evaluation, and verification. This Ã¢â‚¬Å“inclusive participatory ES mappingÃ¢â‚¬Â was conducted in two villages (Bedono and Timbulsloko, Central Java, Indonesia) from 2014 to 2015. Participants representing different community elements were involved in the mapping process. They first created a historical map of the situation in their villages roughly between 1980 and 1999 (before rehabilitation) and then described the subsequent environmental changes. The mapping exercise also documented different mangrove resources that are utilized by communities and identified key areas, such as harvesting zones, biodiversity hotspots, erosion zones, different fishing grounds, and newly rehabilitated areas. The maps reveal that integrating PRM and indigenous geo-referenced information can elicit past and contemporary information on (changes in) ecosystem service availability and use. The results show that by involving local communities from the beginning, the participatory ES mapping can facilitate social learning, provide the foundation for the creation of social capital, and equip the community with sufficient spatial information to improve local mangrove management.

403,An agent-based model to optimize transboundary management for the walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) fishery in the Gulf of Alaska,"Because fish stocks often straddle state, national, and international boundaries, there is a need to coordinate fishery management across jurisdictions. This is particularly important when the abundance or spatial distribution of the stock varies through time. This is best achieved when management objectives and strategies align, and there is coordinated decision-making and catch accounting among jurisdictions such that each fish stock is managed over its full geographic range. However, legal constraints or differing management objectives may not permit such coordinated decision making and policy development. This study introduces a framework for effectively simulating fleet dynamics, fishery quota allocation, and the implications of alternative management strategies while allowing for determination of economically optimal management approaches at the community level. As a case study, an agent-based model (ABM) was developed to examine the interplay between transboundary management scenarios on the economic viability of a nascent Alaska state-waters trawl fishery for walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Gulf of Alaska, given a longstanding federally managed fishery. Under conditions characteristic of the recent past, the management strategy that produced the best overall improvements, relative to status quo, involved a scenario that allows for community-based cooperatives in federal-waters and an open access strategy in state-waters. This case study allows us to demonstrate more generally how using an ABM allows for quantifying the impacts of and informing managers on anticipated, and novel, results of alternative management strategies for complex socioecological systems before implementation.

404,"Soil-transmitted helminths and associated factors among pre-school children in Butajira Town, south-central Ethiopia: A community-based cross-sectional study","Background Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) remain a major public health problem, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Though infections are prevalent among all age groups, the world health organization (WHO) considers Pre-school age children (PSAC), school-aged children, and pregnant women as segments of population at high risk of STH morbidities. Objective This study aimed at determining the prevalence and infection intensity of STH and associated factors among PSAC in Butajira Town, south-central Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June, 2014 in Buta-jira Town. The PSAC were selected by systematic sampling technique and invited to participate in the present study. McMaster technique was employed for parasitological analysis of stool samples. Pearson's Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were performed where appropriate to identify any association between STH infection and independent factors. Multivari-ate logistic regression model was fitted to identify independent predictors of STH among the PSAC. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 377 (with 96% compliance rate) PSAC were able to provide complete data (socio-demographic information and stool sample). The study showed that 23.3% (88/377) PSAC were infected with one or more species of STH. Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent STH (14.9%) followed by Trichuris trichiura (6.4%). The overall infection intensity, expressed as geometric mean for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworms were 229, 178, and 154 eggs per gram of stool, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression model estimated that being in the age group of 36-47 months (AOR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.3, P = 0.016), untrimmed finger nail (AOR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.8-5.5, P < 0.001), and not washing hands before a meal (AOR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7-5.4, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of STH infections among the children.

405,Dredging-induced shell damages to hard clam (Meretrix meretrix): A Malaysian case study,"The hard clam (Meretrix meretrix) is a popular edible shellfish in South and Southeast Asia, being heavily exploited by hand dredging in Marudu Bay, Malaysia. The current study was performed to evaluate the shell damages caused by this artisanal dredging gear. Samplings were conducted in triplicates at two sites using both hand dredging and hand collecting (control) sampling methods. The shell length and total weight, damage areas and breakage patterns of each clam were recorded. A questionnaire survey was conducted with local bivalve harvesters to gather information on the fishing pressure in Marudu Bay. Results revealed that the efficiency (fishing yield) of hand dredging gear was three times higher than hand collecting. However, hand dredging gear causes lethal shell damages to small hard clams (<3cm in shell length). Hard clam harvesting is the main occupation of most fishermen in Kg. Popok, but most of them do not comply with the minimum harvesting size established by the fishery department. Moreover, most of the stakeholders are not aware of the negative impacts of hand dredging to the sustainability of the hard clam fishery in Marudu Bay. Therefore, organizing more awareness programs combined with introducing community-based fishery management are highly recommended to promote the sustainability of this artisanal fishery.

406,"Detecting, counting and following the giants of the sea: A review of monitoring methods for aquatic megavertebrates in the Caribbean","The Caribbean is a mega-diverse and bio-geographically important region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands, and surrounding coastlines. Among the billions of aquatic species inhabiting this region, the mega-vertebrates stand out for their social, economic and ecologic relevance. However, the Caribbean has been threatened by climate change, poverty, pollution, environmental degradation and intense growth of the tourism industry, affecting megafauna species directly and indirectly. Population monitoring plays a critical role in an informed conservation process and helps guide management decisions at several scales. The aim of the present review was to critically examine the methods employed for monitoring marine megafauna in the Caribbean, so as to create a framework for future monitoring efforts. In total, 235 documents describing protocols for the monitoring of sirenians, cetaceans, elasmobranchs, sea turtles and crocodilians in the Caribbean region, were reviewed. The methods included community-based monitoring (interviews, citizen science and fisheries monitoring), aerial surveys (by manned and unmanned aerial vehicles), boat-based surveys (including manta tow, and side-scan sonars), land-based surveys, acoustic monitoring, underwater surveys, baited remote underwater video, mark-recapture, photo-identification and telemetry. Monitoring efforts invested on aquatic megafauna in the Caribbean have been highly different, with some species and/or groups being prioritised over others. The present critical review provides a country-based overview of the current and emerging methods for monitoring marine megafauna and a critical evaluation of their known advantages, disadvantages and biases.

407,"Ecological assessment of the marine ecosystems of Barbuda, West Indies: Using rapid scientific assessment to inform ocean zoning and fisheries management","To inform a community-based ocean zoning initiative, we conducted an intensive ecological assessment of the marine ecosystems of Barbuda, West Indies. We conducted 116 fish and 108 benthic surveys around the island, and measured the abundance and size structure of lobsters and conch at 52 and 35 sites, respectively. We found that both coral cover and fish biomass were similar to or lower than levels observed across the greater Caribbean; live coral cover and abundance of fishery target species, such as large snappers and groupers, was generally low. However, Barbuda lacks many of the high-relief forereef areas where similar work has been conducted in other Caribbean locations. The distribution of lobsters was patchy, making it difficult to quantify density at the island scale. However, the maximum size of lobsters was generally larger than in other locations in the Caribbean and similar to the maximum size reported 40 years ago. While the lobster population has clearly been heavily exploited, our data suggest that it is not as overexploited as in much of the rest of the Caribbean. Surveys of BarbudaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Codrington Lagoon revealed many juvenile lobsters, but none of legal size (95 mm carapace length), suggesting that the lagoon functions primarily as nursery habitat. Conch abundance and size on Barbuda were similar to that of other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that many of the regional threats observed on other Caribbean islands are present on Barbuda, but some resourcesÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly lobster and conchÃ¢â‚¬â€may be less overexploited than on other Caribbean islands. Local management has the potential to provide sustainability for at least some of the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marine resources. We show that a rapid, thorough ecological assessment can reveal clear conservation opportunities and facilitate rapid conservation action by providing the foundation for a community-driven policymaking process at the island scale.

408,Policy challenges and approaches for the conservation of mangrove forests in Southeast Asia,"Many drivers of mangrove forest loss operate over large scales and are most effectively addressed by policy interventions. However, conflicting or unclear policy objectives exist at multiple tiers of government, resulting in contradictory management decisions. To address this, we considered four approaches that are being used increasingly or could be deployed in Southeast Asia to ensure sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. First, a stronger incorporation of mangroves into marine protected areas (that currently focus largely on reefs and fisheries) could resolve some policy conflicts and ensure that mangroves do not fall through a policy gap. Second, examples of community and government comanagement exist, but achieving comanagement at scale will be important in reconciling stakeholders and addressing conflicting policy objectives. Third, private-sector initiatives could protect mangroves through existing and novel mechanisms in degraded areas and areas under future threat. Finally, payments for ecosystem services (PES) hold great promise for mangrove conservation, with carbon PES schemes (known as blue carbon) attracting attention. Although barriers remain to the implementation of PES, the potential to implement them at multiple scales exists. Closing the gap between mangrove conservation policies and action is crucial to the improved protection and management of this imperiled coastal ecosystem and to the livelihoods that depend on them.

409,Size-structured habitat selection by arapaima in floodplain lakes of the Lower Amazon,"Human modification of floodplain ecosystems is widespread and a major threat to fish populations, particularly in the tropics where fish diversity and rates of floodplain degradation are high. Identifying measures to minimize the susceptibility of floodplain fishes to habitat modification requires understanding dry-season lake habitat selection for species of conservation concern. This study examined the effects of environmental factors on dry-season floodplain lake habitat selection by arapaima (Arapaima spp.) and determined the extent to which they differed across three size classes. In floodplain lakes of the lower Amazon River, variables were measured at locations representing habitat availability and compared with measurements taken where arapaima were observed during surface breathing. Regression models were used to account for between-lake variation in the presence of arapaima owing to nearby fishing communities. The probability of arapaima presence at each sample location was modelled based on the variables measured. The results indicated that arapaima expressed distinct habitat selection patterns, which differed significantly across size classes. The general pattern observed was that all arapaima were more likely to be found in deeper, more turbid, and higher conductivity locations, whereas smaller arapaima were more likely to remain near dense beds of floating macrophytes. The probability of arapaima presence differed among fishing community territories, reflecting differences in management schemes. Deeper, macrophyte-rich sections of floodplain lakes appear to provide key habitats for arapaima and deserve consideration for becoming priority targets for conservation of the rich diversity of fish species in these systems.

410,Antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP): An effective implementing technique for the therapy efficiency of meropenem and vancomycin antibiotics in Iranian pediatric patients,"Background: Antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is a distinguished method to improve the prescription and efficacy of antibiotics. Aim: The efficacy of ASP and conventional methods was compared to measure the effectiveness of meropenem (MPM) and vancomycin (VMN) antibiotics in pediatric patients. Design: In an interventional quasi-experimental study, 135 children admitted in Children's Hospital affiliated to University of Medical Sciences in time periods of 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 were assessed. Methods: The conventional and ASP methods in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 were respectively utilized to provide the best antimicrobial therapy of MPM and VMN antibiotics in patient children. The data of mortality rate (MR), antibiotic prescription (AP), antibiotic dose (ADe), antibiotic duration (ADn), length of hospital stay (LOHS), and blood cultures (BCs) were compared across the years using the Chi square, independent t test, and Fisher's exact test. Results: The levels of MR, AP, ADe, ADn, LOHS, and positive BCs using the ASP method in 2015-2016 were significantly lower those of in 2014-2015 using the conventional one (p < 0.05).

412,Community-level analysis of correlated fish production in fisheries and aquaculture: The case of Japan,"Global aquaculture production is expected to exceed marine capture production by 2030. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between coastal fisheries and aquaculture production at community level is required for fishery managers to ensure the efficient use of resources and to minimise potential conflicts between resource users. Improving communitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to flexibly adjust the production mix between the two is also crucial to enhance communitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resilience to external shocks, such as climate change and resource depletion. Based on data from Japan's Census of Fisheries, a panel data set of 1922 fishing communities show that a decrease in the number of coastal fishing entities within a community is partially offset by an increasing number of aquaculture entities, suggesting that coastal fisheries and aquaculture production are negatively related at community level. The results also show that changes in production mix are not solely determined within the community per se but also depend on the production mix in neighbouring communities.

However, the effectiveness of fisheries co-management has varied considerably, especially in low-income settings. Although research into co-management is growing, there are few accounts of co-management that explore the experiences of community leaders and how their role within co-management institutions fits within the broader social and economic context of their lives. In this article, I utilise qualitative data collected from two landing sites on Lake Victoria, Uganda where the growth of the Nile perch export market in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in rapid social and economic change on the lakeshore. I explore how the attitudes and actions of the individuals who lead local co-management institutions are not simply governed by assumed economic incentives but are affected by complex social and political factors. I also consider how the co-management institutions are perceived by community members more broadly.

414,Frailty and Associated Factors among the Elderly in Vietnam: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Background: Frailty syndrome is common among older people and can lead to various adverse consequences such as falls, cognitive decline, disability, dependent living, increased mortality, excessive drug use, and prolonged hospital stays. Objectives: This research determined the prevalence of frailty and associated factors among older adults in Vietnam. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 584 older adults across five Ho Chi Minh City wards from November 2020 to January 2021. Based on the modified Fried frailty scale, the participants were divided into three categories: robust, pre-frail, and frail. A chi-square test (or FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s test) examined the relationship between frailty categories and other variables. Multivariable logistic regression used variates with a cut-off of p Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05 in the univariate analysis. Results: The prevalence rates of frailty and pre-frailty were 19% and 64%, respectively. The most common frailty component was weak grip strength (63.9%), followed by slowness (36.1%), weight loss (21.6%), low physical activity (19.5%), and exhaustion (18.5%). In addition, the prevalence of frailty was significantly associated with age, BMI levels, living alone, and sarcopenia. Conclusion: The communityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prevalence of frailty among older adults is high. Frailty can lead to many adverse consequences for the elderly. As there were some modifiable factors associated with frailty, it should be assessed in older people through community-based healthcare programs for early diagnosis and management.

415,Is community-based management of small-scale fisheries in Sierra Leone the answer to their problems?,"With increasing decline in global fish stocks and the possibility of extinction of many small-scale fisheries (SSF) partly because of over-fishing by large-scale industrial fishers (both licensed and unlicensed) and partly because of harmful fishing gear used by small-scale fishers themselves, researchers are focusing on alternatives to the prevailing top-down systems of fisheries management. One such alternative that is receiving attention is the community-based approach to the governance of SSF, which maintains that small-scale or artisanal fishers have a special attachment to their geographical area which makes them better managers of their fish resources. This study investigates the viability of this approach in Sierra Leone's Tombo and Goderich fishing communities. Fieldwork was carried out during 2017 and 2019 when a total of 51 key informant (KI) and 14 telephone interviews (TI) were conducted, and 200 survey questionnaires (SQ) were distributed in the two communities. The main finding is that although several community fisheries organisations (CFO) try to manage coastal stocks, they have no power to curb industrial over-fishing, and their power to stop artisanal fishers using harmful gear is compromised by government interference and by conflicts between CFOs. The study concludes that both top-down (governmental) and bottom-up (communitarian) approaches to SSF management have flaws, and each side needs to acknowledge its flaws, and work together with the other side to eliminate them.

416,Understanding the access to livelihood assets and fishers' perceptions towards local practice for wetland fisheries sustainability,"This study was conducted to explore the livelihood status and fishersÃ¢â‚¬Å¸ perceptions of local fisheries management practice in the Ashura floodplain of Dinajpur, Bangladesh. Data were collected from July to December 2020 through a semi-structured questionnaire. Five different forms of livelihood capitals (assets) were studied. From the human capital view, most of the fishers belonged to the 36-55 years age group. About 8% of fishers were illiterate and 56% could only sign their names. 10% of the fishers had no formal training. 67 % of the fishers had annual incomes ranging from 20000 to 36000 BDT,. while 27% of fishers were in the medium income group (36001-72000 BDT) and 6% were in the high-income group (72001-108000 BDT per year). On the social capital aspect, 48% of the fishers had no organizational participation. Physical capital showed had the highest index value of 2.31, which indicates a relatively good availability of physical resources, while financial capital recorded had the lowest index value of 1.39, suggesting a very poor economic condition. Several problems were reported, including malnutrition, lack of other employment opportunities, insufficient releasing and stocking of fish seed and brood fish, insufficient educational institutions, lack of community-based fisheries management etc. Among them, malnutrition (PCI, 243) was the major problem in this area.

418,"Sustainable development of Lagong Hill forest reserve, Malaysia","Lagong Hill Forest Reserve, gazetted as a forest reserve, is rich in forest biodiversity and is also a water catchment area. The aim of this paper is to assess Lagong Hill Forest Reserve from the perspective of sustainable development. The concept of resource transition by relying on nature's ""income"" without depleting its ""capital"" is applied. Inclusive in the assessment of sustainable development is cultural pluralism as there are two indigenous settlements in this forest reserve. The major findings are related to the economic activities of quarrying, timber production and ecotourism, and the livelihood of the indigenous villagers, in terms of their impact on sustainable development. Quarrying is an extractive industry based on finite resources. This is basically depleting the ""capital"" of this forest reserve. In addition, rehabilitation and beautification works needs to be taken at the end of the concession period to prevent rock fall or landside and also for aesthetics respectively. The adoption of Reduced Impact Logging on a compartmental basis can lead to sustainable timber by tapping on natures ""income"" without depleting its ""capital"". However, a more detailed scientific research needs to be undertaken to assess the impact of quarrying and timber production on soil erosion, water catchment functionality and forest biodiversity. The park management of the ecotourism resort accords the highest priority towards nature conservation. Nature conservation is tapping on the ""interest"" without depleting its ""capital"". However, a scientific determination of carrying capacity is required for its expansion plan. The indigenous people not only ""take"" from the forest in terms of fish and forest produce but also ""give"" in return by being the custodians or guardians of the forest.

420,Predation and competition: The impact of fisheries on marine-mammal populations over the next one hundred years,"We discuss the potential for commercial fisheries to adversely impact Ã¢â€°Â¥1 population of marine mammal by the end of the 21st century. To a large degree, patterns over the last 50 years regarding human population growth, success and failure in marine-fisheries management, and life history and status information on marine mammals are the basis for 6 predictions. First, annual worldwide landings of fish and shellfish by the end of the 21st century will be less than 80 million tons. Second, virtually all of the predictions regarding species composition and energy flow within a marine community, based on models developed to date with incomplete information on species abundance, food habits, genetic effects of fishing, and variability of predator food habits, will prove wrong on a decadal or longer time scale. Third, the most common type of competitive interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries will be that in which commercial fisheries adversely affect a marine-mammal population by depleting localized food resources without necessarily overfishing the target species of fish (or shellfish). Because of this, the number of extant populations and species richness of marine mammals will be reduced by the end of the 21st century, and coastal populations and species will be affected more negatively than will noncoastal species. Fifth, predator control programs designed to reduce local populations of marine mammals will be common without changes in existing forms of fishery management.

421,Hawaiian Islands Marine Ecosystem case study: Ecosystem- and community-based management in Hawaii,"The Hawaiian Islands comprise a large and isolated archipelago that includes the largest reef area in the United States. Managing nearshore fisheries in this archipelago is a major challenge compounded by the difficulty of coordinating multiple agencies to provide governance across a broad series of islands with substantial social and political differences. There has been interest in, and progress toward, key elements of ecosystem-based management (EBM) in Hawaii, including a network of MPAs and community-based co-management. However, progress has been slow and largely driven by increased attention to the risks facing coral reef ecosystems, enabling both legislation and emergence of local engagement in fishery issues. Key elements of EBM in Hawaii include enhanced coordination among multiple agencies, establishment of place-based and community-based (or Hawaiian ahupua'a'-based) co-management, and acquisition of data on both the ecology of the nearshore system and the role of human impacts for use in management decisions. The development of community-based co-management and an MPA network along the western Kohala-Kona coast of the island of Hawaii (West Hawaii) illustrates a unique approach demonstrating an incremental approach toward EBM. Nonetheless, there are major challenges to scaling up the West Hawaii model to other islands within the state. These challenges include (1) the limited extent of community involvement, as well as legislative and administrative support, of community-based co-management and MPAs, (2) the complexity of conflicts that develop on more populated islands with diverse stakeholders, (3) weaken forcement of fishing regulations, and (4) whether synergy among federal, state, and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the scientific community will be sustainable.

422,Power play: ethical dilemmas of dealing with local officials and politicians: Experiences from post-tsunami research in Sri Lanka,"This request came in an interview with a politician and former Minister in Sri Lanka. The purpose of the interview was to find out how he perceived the roles, activities, and behavior of households, aid officials, and other politicians in the area in the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami. Yet the timing of the interview coincided with impending Southern Provincial Council Elections. Researchers are not always able to walk away from interviews merely with recordings and notes. Through their presence in the field, relationships they form with the research community, rapport they build with respondents, and methods of enquiry they employ, researchers create bonds with the researched. These bonds can result in difficult circumstances for the researcher, giving rise to ethical dilemmas about appropriate behavior. The ideal of the researcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impartiality is not realistic in most qualitative fieldwork. In the above case I did not want to give an immediate negative response that might have offended or disappointed my interviewee. His request came toward the end of the interview, but I was still conducting research in the area and did not want him to endanger forthcoming interviews. I was put in an awkward position with implications of unethical dealings on my part. I will reveal my response later in this chapter after exploring the difficulties related to behaving Ã¢â‚¬Ëœethically.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Much research in the field of development is focused on poor and disadvantaged members of society, but some research involves individuals who hold or have held privileged positions in society and who therefore are in possession of more wealth, political power, or influence than the general public. Such research on the powerful is known as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœstudying upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and involves a different set of practical challenges and ethical complexities compared to studies where the researcher tends to have more power than the researched. Ã¢â‚¬ËœStudying upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ can be problematic as respondents have the power to create barriers, shield themselves from scrutiny, and resist the intrusiveness of social research (Duke 2002). The researcher can face ethical dilemmas in terms of gaining access, responding to corrupt practices, effective positioning, ensuring confidentiality of data and anonymity of respondents, and upholding reciprocal relations. In this chapter I relay my experiences of dealing with local officials and politicians (see the chapters by Chopra, Dam and Lunn, and Wang in this volume for examples of dealing with other types of elites). The purpose of my doctoral fieldwork in Sri Lanka was to explore how livelihoods were recovering after the 2004 tsunami, with specific reference to two fisher villages in the Hambantota District in the Southern Province (Mubarak 2011). I probed commonly overlooked social and political processes in post-tsunami livelihoods recovery using a qualitative ethnographic methodology that examined narratives emerging from households, local officials of government organizations and NGOs, office bearers of community-based organizations, local politicians, village leaders, and key informants. This included an investigation into practices of corruption and political interference at the village level. The aim was to advance conceptualizations of informal politics in South Asia. Local government officials played a key role in the official distribution of aid in these villages, while politicians were significant as an informal means of accessing aid. What follows are my reflections on interviewing these powerful people, focusing on five key interrelated ethical issues: access, corruption, positionality, confidentiality, and reciprocity.

423,Neither bust nor boom: Institutional robustness in the beach seine fishery of southern Sri Lanka,"Many fisheries authorities in the world have been compelled to accept community-based management as an invaluable means to formulate fisheries management due to failures of small-scale fisheries exclusively managed by centralized units. Beach seine fishing practices in Sri Lanka are known to be institutionalized by traditional community-based coastal fisheries management systems. Eight beach seine fisher communities in southern Sri Lanka were studied, using standard ethnographic methods, to ascertain and document the rules and norms that are in general not formerly codified in writing, and evaluate empirically the compliance of institutional arrangements with Ostrom's modified design principles for long enduring common pool resources (CPR) management systems. Fishing rights were vested to the villagers as a residential proximity right. Due to this tradition, ownership of a beach seine and fishing rights at fishing territory vested them as; exclusive, primary or secondary rights. The sole authority for governing CPR was vested to community organization termed ""madel samithi"" (beach seine society), which can be treated as the local administrative unit. Institutions governing the CPR addressed the excludability problem by defining fishing territory, eligibility rules and intercommunity access rule, while subtractability problem was addressed by gear rules, temporal allocation rules, first comer rules, fishing behaviour rules, conservation rules, and rules for distribution of benefits. The study highlighted that institutional architecture of beach seine fishery of southern Sri Lanka comprised all modified design principles and, 90.9% of those exhibited higher compliance (54.5% - high compliance and 36.4% - very high compliance) with modified design principles. Higher compliance of institutional arrangements with modified design principles indicates robust and stable self-governing institutions. Beach seine fishing in southern Sri Lanka is therefore an example for community-based coastal fisheries management system that relies on strong, locally crafted rules as well as evolved norms, where institutional and governance mechanisms have essentially averted the tragedy, providing significant contribution to coastal economy. Study provides the starkness to the notion that local actors in tropical community-based marine resource systems overcome the CPR dilemmas through robust self-governing institutions.

424,Engaging local communities in wildlife management area planning: An evaluation of the Lake Ontario Islands search conference,"Public participation in wildlife management has grown. Public hearings, historically a common approach to public participation in governmental decision-making, often proved unsatisfactory to both citizens and managers. Many wildlife agencies have moved beyond public hearings to more inquisitive approaches (e.g., public meetings, scientific surveys of stakeholders, focus groups) that solicit input during development of a management plan. Often, however, managers still find themselves ""stuck in the middle,"" conveying the values of every stakeholder group to every other group. Seeking an alternative that would engage stakeholders directly with one another and promote greater collaboration with local communities, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) cooperated with Cornell University in an innovative approach to wildlife management area (WMA) planning. Using a participatory planning process called a search conference, NYSDEC engaged a diverse range of stakeholders from local communities in planning for the Lake Ontario Islands Wildlife Management Area (LOIWMA), located in New York's Eastern Lake Ontario Basin. Planning occurred within a climate of ongoing controversy over management of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). Evaluation comments from search conference participants, including fish and wildlife managers, suggested that the event increased understanding among stakeholders, elicited input from stakeholders with diverse interests and concerns, strengthened relationships, enhanced agency credibility, and identified concrete actions for the LOIWMA plan and for broader community initiatives. Implementation of community-based actions has been limited, however, by lack of a democratic structure for continued collaboration.

425,"Community-based tourism and the development of local small businesses in rural Baja California, Mexico","Rethinking rural tourism as an alternative path toward sustainable tourism is the focus of this paper. Rural tourism involves leisure quality activities with greater advantages: it is done in the outskirts, causes low environmental and sociocultural impact, and provides experiences that enrich the spirit and personality of tourists. Furthermore, it helps understand the host rural communities through friendly and respectful contact, and at the same time it generates profitable revenue which accrues a beneficial effect on the aforementioned communities. An overall tourism-based strategy of local development will require, as a condition to its feasibility, to reassess the active role of the communities, recognizing that it is in their own geographical and social scenario where all touristic activities happens, even if those are classified as small-scale economic activities. Therefore, the strategic priority requires that the local host community should be involved in all the working processes from the beginning. Effective sustainable options should then start there, ""from below"", considering economic alternatives but above all being sensitive to natural, environmental and sociocultural viability, as well as taking into account the so-called ""from the inside"" perspective. Having started in 2003 and continuing to date, this academic task has provided to its contributors, Universidad AutÃƒÂ³noma de Baja California researchers, the working experience with rural communities with feasible touristic possibilities. It has created, as well, the opportunity to get involved with the small farming and fishing communities of Baja California. These communities are also beginning to think about social welfare opportunities linked to the development and strengthening of micro and small enterprises which offer touristic services on a small scale, operating on their own, and whose benefits represent a genuine option to reduce poverty, based not only on natural and cultural attractions but also through genuine local management, organization and work.

426,Limnological perspectives on conservation of floodplain lakes in the Amazon basin,"Limnological aspects of Amazon floodplain lakes are examined in the context of aquatic conservation. A prerequisite to detecting and evaluating changes that could threaten the ecological health and organisms in floodplain lakes is understanding variation under present conditions. Based on one of the few studies with regular measurements over 2 years, chlorophyll, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, transparency, and total suspended solids in Lake JanauacÃƒÂ¡ indicate that the lake is naturally quite variable with a mesotrophic to eutrophic status. Direct threats to ecological health of floodplain lakes include mining operations that can increase turbidity and trace metals and reduce nutritional quality of sediments. Mercury contamination and methylation leads to bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. Deforestation in uplands increases nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to floodplain lakes and can alter trophic status. Deforestation in floodable forests alters the habitat and food of the fish that inhabit these forests. Cumulative limnological responses as catchments are altered by urban, agricultural, and industrial developments, and as inundation is altered by changes in climate and construction of dams, have major implications for the ecology of floodplain lakes. To improve understanding and management of threats to the conservation of aquatic Amazon biota and ecosystems requires considerably expanded and coordinated research and community-based management that includes the spectrum of floodplain lakes throughout the basin.

428,"Fishery of mud crab Scylla serrata of Kotania Bay, Western Seram District: Potency, stock status and sustainable management","Study on the fishery of mud crab Scylla sp. of Portunid crab at Kotania Bay of Western Seram District was conducted between March and August 2018. The objectives of this study were to analyze biological parameters, the potency, stock status, sustainability, and to propose a sustainable management plan for this fishery. A total of 592 individual mud crab sample were collected from local fisher for biological parameters analysis. Historical catch data from local fisher, mud crab collector and fishery enumerator were used to analyze stock biomass, fishing intensity and stock status using Graham-Schaefer dynamic model. Rapfish analysis was used to analyze the sustainability of the stock. The carapace width ranged from 7.80 - 23.50 cm with an average of 13.68 cm (Ã‚Â±2.25). There was a strong relationship between carapace width-weight (r = 0.9405) with overall growth pattern of isometric. The estimated stock biomass of mud crab of Kotania Bay was 130,000 t with BMSY of 22,425 t.yr-1, and mud crab fishery was under overfishing status. The overall sustainability was 46.92% and was considered as less sustain according to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Most sensitive attributes affecting sustainability were catching before maturity, consumer attitude towards sustainability, gear side effect, just governance, and government quality.

429,"End-To-End Models for the Analysis of Marine Ecosystems: Challenges, Issues, and Next Steps","There is growing interest in models of marine ecosystems that deal with the effects of climate change through the higher trophic levels. Such end-to-end models combine physicochemical oceanographic descriptors and organisms ranging from microbes to higher-trophic-level (HTL) organisms, including humans, in a single modeling framework. The demand for such approaches arises from the need for quantitative tools for ecosystem-based management, particularly models that can deal with bottom-up and top-down controls that operate simultaneously and vary in time and space and that are capable of handling the multiple impacts expected under climate change. End-to-end models are now feasible because of improvements in the component submodels and the availability of sufficient computing power. We discuss nine issues related to the development of end-to-end models. These issues relate to formulation of the zooplankton submodel, melding of multiple temporal and spatial scales, acclimation and adaptation, behavioral movement, software and technology, model coupling, skill assessment, and interdisciplinary challenges. We urge restraint in using end-to-end models in a true forecasting mode until we know more about their performance. End-to-end models will challenge the available data and our ability to analyze and interpret complicated models that generate complex behavior. End-to-end modeling is in its early developmental stages and thus presents an opportunity to establish an open-access, community-based approach supported by a suite of true interdisciplinary efforts.

430,An assessment of the current status of the chokka squid fishery in South Africa and an evaluation of alternative allocation strategies,"The South African squid fishery is based on a single species, Loligo reynaudi, locally referred to as chokka and commonly found around the Agulhas Bank and West Coast shelf of South Africa. The existing long term rights for participation in the fishery expire at the end of 2013 and a new set of rights will have to be issued. Progress made to date in achieving the objectives of the South African Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA), including progress towards greater equity, will be an important consideration in allocation decisions. The draft Small-Scale Fisheries Policy, scheduled to be adopted in 2013, could also influence the criteria to be used. This study updates the information on the current structure and functioning of the squid jig sector and considers the likely performance of two alternative access allocation scenarios against the current and evolving policy goals. The study reaffirms that the squid fishery is an important contributor to human well-being in South Africa and particularly in the Eastern Cape Province but there is scope for improvement in the extent of transformation and equity. The study concludes that, as a result of a common lack of experience and capital amongst potential new entrants, the risks associated with transformation in this fishery are likely to be high, especially if the option of allocating rights to community-based legal entities was to be used. The risks could be reduced by ensuring that a number of pre-conditions were met. These include, amongst others, not allowing total effort in the fishery to increase; ensuring effective management by the responsible government authorities; adequate capacity building of new entrants, whether individuals or cooperatives; and ensuring new entrants have viable business plans.

431,"Fishery trends, resource-use and management system in the Ungwana Bay fishery Kenya","The present study assessed trends in resource-use, partitioning and management in the Ungwana Bay fishery, Kenya, using surplus production models. The fishery is one of East Africa's important marine fisheries sustaining a bottom trawl commercial fishery and a resident-migrant artisanal fishery. Two models: Schaefer (1954) and Gulland and Fox (1975) were applied to catch-effort data over a 21-year period to model maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and optimal effort (fMSY) to examine the status of resource exploitation and provide reference points for sustainable management. In the artisanal fishery, model MSYs range from 392-446 t to 1283-1473 t for shrimps and fish respectively compared to mean annual landings of 60 t for shrimp and 758 t for fish. These landings represent &lt;50% of the model MSYs suggesting under exploitation in the sub-sector. Moreover, current fishing effort applied stands at &lt;0.5 fMSY. On the other hand, mean annual landings in bottom trawl commercial fishery, at about 330 t for shrimps and 583 t and fish represent about 90% of the model MSYs of 352-391 t and 499-602 t for shrimps and fish respectively. Therefore, the bottom trawl commercial fishery is likely under full exploitation. Similarly, the current effort is estimated at &gt;0.7 fMSY. Resource management in the bay is faced with numerous problems including resource-use conflicts, poor economic conditions in artisanal fishery, poor legislation, and inadequate research augmented by poor reporting systems for catch-effort statistics. Thus, the fishery lacks clearly defined exploitation regimes. Fisheries research and assessment of the marine resources are important for sustainability of the fishery. Moreover, income diversification in the poverty ridden artisanal fishery would go a long way in addressing resource-use conflicts and use of deleterious fishing methods in the sub-sector. Borrowing from the successes of the Japanese community-based fisheries resource management (CBFRM) which has easily resolved numerous fisheries management issues in coastal small-scale commercial fisheries, and the beach management unit (BMU) system which has been applied to the artisanal fisheries of south coast Kenya with enormous benefits, it is envisaged that a hybrid CBFRM-BMU system presents the best approach to sustainable resource-use in the Ungwana Bay fishery.

432,Conservation of migratory fishes in the Amazon basin,"The Amazon basin hosts the Earth's highest diversity of freshwater fish. Fish species have adapted to the basin's size and seasonal dynamics by displaying a broad range of migratory behaviour, but they are under increasing threats; however, no study to date has assessed threats and conservation of Amazonian migratory fishes. Here, the available knowledge on the diversity of migratory behaviour in Amazonian fishes is synthesized, including the geographical scales at which they occur, their drivers and timing, and life stage at which they are performed. Migratory fishes are integral components of Amazonian society. They contribute about 93% (range 77Ã¢â‚¬â€œ99%) of the fisheries landings in the basin, amounting to ~US$436 million annually. These valuable fish populations are mainly threatened by growing trends of overexploitation, deforestation, climate change, and hydroelectric dam development. Most Amazonian migratory fish have key ecological roles as apex predators, ecological engineers, or seed-dispersal species. Reducing their population sizes could induce cascading effects with implications for ecosystem stability and associated services. Conserving Amazonian migratory fishes requires a broad portfolio of research, management, and conservation actions, within an ecosystem-based management framework at the basin scale. This would require trans-frontier coordination and recognition of the crucial importance of freshwater ecosystems and their connectivity. Existing areas where fishing is allowed could be coupled with a chain of freshwater protected areas. Management of commercial and subsistence species also needs fisheries activities to be monitored in the Amazonian cities and in the floodplain communities to allow assessments of the status of target species, and the identification of management units or stocks. Ensuring that existing and future fisheries management rules are effective implies the voluntary participation of fishers, which can be achieved by increasing the effectiveness and coverage of adaptive community-based management schemes.

This anthropological study contributes to the cross-disciplinary discussion of community-based resource management. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on ethnographic fieldwork done at the Nanfang'ao port located in northeastern Taiwan. This port has several prosperous offshore fisheries including a mackerel fishery. The mackerel fishery has undergone important transformations in recent decades. The first was a total transformation of fishing methods in 2013. The second was the government's formulation of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Regulations for Fishing Vessels Catching Mackerels and Jacks,Ã¢â‚¬Â implemented in 2014. This research illustrates how people in a community take various approaches to pursue sustainability for the human beings and the more-than-human world.

434,Towards community- and scientific-based information integration in marine resource management in Indonesia: Bunaken National Park case study,"Community involvement in marine resource management is evolving in Indonesia. In 1997 a major initiative was undertaken by the Government of Indonesia to decentralize management efforts from central to local levels for several national marine parks, including Bunaken National Park in the northern region of the country. This initiative marked a major milestone in the process of democratic reform. In this article, the evolution of Bunaken National Park community involvement in marine resource management prior to the period of democratic reform until the present is described. In the current and still evolving management strategy, community involvement occurs in a collaborative manner with input from government and non-government stakeholders. This research highlights the centerpiece of collaborative efforts, the participatory zonation process and product, and the differing roles of community and scientific information in the zonation construction process. Community-based information, for example, provides local perspectives on the use of shared coastal resources, while scientific information provides insight into the health status of resources within shallow water areas. In September 2004, the Bunaken Park Management Advisory Board (MAB) acknowledged the need to integrate greater scientific information into its management strategy for marine resource evaluation and monitoring purposes. This presents a unique opportunity to examine how satellite imagery, which may be used to identify the spatial location of specific coastal features and detect their change through time, can be linked with local community participation for the purpose of managing human activities within a marine resources environment. Thus, this article contributes to ongoing research linking geospatial technologies with local community participation.

435,Effect of predictive factors on sustainable development and management of fresh water wetland fisheries,"Wetlands of India are basically low-lying areas and are one of the most important and potential inland natural fish habitats of the country and provide livelihood to millions of poor fishers living around them. In India, they account for a total area of 3.54 lakh ha covering states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Asom and other North-East states. The present annual fish yield from these wetlands is 350 kg/ha on the average against estimated production potential of 1500kg/ha/year. Among the Indian states, Asom is endowed with myriads of wetlands ranging from 35 to 3458.12 ha in water spread area. The average existing fish production from wetlands of Asom 173 kg/ha/year against its production potential of 1,000-1,500 kg/ha/year and several factors, viz. habitat alteration, over exploitation, lack of scientific management, encroachment, etc., are responsible for poor productivity of the wetlands. Hence, a study was conducted in 4 selected floodplain wetlands of the state namely Talu Malu (22.0 ha), Amuguri Basapathar (50.0 ha), Kutuha Bar (16.0 ha) and Bhitorkuri (20.0 ha) floodplain wetlands to see the critical factors associated with sustainable development and management of wetlands.

Factors hypothesized to influence success include intrinsic community characteristics, project input levels, and change agent characteristics. An empirical analysis of these hypotheses was conducted using a sample of 24 villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, where marine reserves were in early phases of establishment. Factors found to influence the rate of progress were village complexity, level of development, project input levels, characteristics of community organizers, and degree of community organizer homophily relative to the community. These findings are important for community-based marine conservation initiatives conducting simultaneous interventions in multiple communities.

438,Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.),"The Hawaiian Islands are the fifth largest in terms of land area (16,643 km2), and with 1.3 million people, the second most populous of the archipelagos in the tropical Pacific. The principal islands are in two groups: eight large and several smaller volcanic islands in the warmer southeast end of the chain where the human population is concentrated, and very small volcanic and coral islands and atolls to the northwest which are uninhabited or sparsely inhabited. Marine biodiversity is high in terms of habitat quantity, variety, and degree of endemism but lower in terms of species richness. Hawai'i is geographically the most isolated island chain in the world. The people rely heavily on air and sea transportation for maintaining an economy dependent on tourism, military expenditures, and agriculture. The population has expanded rapidly since World War II, with three-fourths residing on O'ahu, and most living in or near the main city of Honolulu. During the earlier part of this century, plantation agriculture (sugar cane, pineapple), ranching, grazing of feral animals, military construction, and transportation projects changed the marine environment via the draining of wetlands, dredging and filling coastal areas, and the flushing of eroded soils. Urbanization now fuels coastal construction, resort and golf course development, increased coastal pollution, coastal flooding, sedimentation, and overfishing in nearshore waters. Alien and invasive species, derelict fishing gear, shark finning, and depletion of fish stocks are now emerging as major marine environmental concerns, along with poorly regulated aquarium fish collection, ship groundings, anchor damage, and overuse of popular coastal parks, beaches, and nearshore reefs. The endemic monk seal and many seabirds are being threatened by commercial fishing off remote reefs. Green sea turtles are afflicted with a poorly understood disease. The incidence of coral bleaching and diseases appears to be increasing, although existing levels are low. Hawai'i contains 84% of all reefs under U.S. jurisdiction, accounting for 17,520 km2 of habitat above a depth of 200 m. The northwest islands account for 82% of the Hawaiian total. Together with adjacent beaches and waters, the reefs support millions of dollars of economic activity, including marine and coastal tourism, sport-fishing, subsistence fishing, commercial fishing, commercial and recreational boating, scientific research, and mariculture development. The coral reefs also afford natural protection and anchorages for boats, and protect coastal property and beaches from the damaging effects of tropical storms and large waves. Extensive local, state, and federal environmental legislation and regulations exist, and there are adequate controls over solid waste, coastal water pollution, further draining or loss of wetlands, and coastal construction. The state and the four county governments, with federal support, have active programs that regulate development in the coastal zone. The network of federal and state marine and coastal protected areas is substantial, especially in the northwest islands.

439,Accounting for heterogeneity in small-scale fisheries management: The Amazon case,"Tropical small-scale fisheries are highly heterogeneous with respect to a wide range of fisheries characteristics, but that heterogeneity has generally not been adequately studied or considered in management. This study investigated fisheries heterogeneity and the extent to which it is accounted for in management regulations in eight small-scale fishing communities located in floodplain ecosystems of the Amazon basin. Analyses of 29,844 fishery landing interview data revealed that fisheries heterogeneity with respect to gear, habitat, species composition, and total catch and fishing effort was high across all communities, but low over the years in the same communities, indicating that each community must be considered as a distinct management unit. Data analyses also revealed that many important community fisheries characteristics were not accounted for by government- and community-based management regulations. Total catch and fishing effort were largely unregulated; there were no size or closed season limits for one-third of the most important fishery species; and the nursery habitats used by most fishery species were not protected in any fashion. Clearly, increased attention to cross-community fisheries heterogeneity can improve the design and implementation of management regulations. The management problems created by the heterogeneity of small-scale fisheries are discussed, and the potential of the ""barefoot ecologist"" concept to address them is considered.

440,Consumers as co-creators in community-based tourism experience: Impacts on their motivation and satisfaction,"A tourism experience is a continuous process. Yet, the following question remains an outstanding issue: How to account for a memorable experience when the experience encompasses periods that occur before, during, and after visiting a destination? Community-based tourism (CBT) allows visitors to establish a positive experience by playing an active role before, during, and after visiting a destination. The aim of this study is to create a comprehensive research framework to examine the overall experience of tourists when they act as co-creators. The survey design was used to collect 239 valid samples after tourists participated in a CBT activity situated in a traditional fishing village. Based on statistical results from partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), this study demonstrates that: (1) There was a more positive impact on co-creation of the CBT experience for tourists with a recreational motivation than those with a learning motivation. (2) Co-creation of the CBT experience had positive impacts on both satisfaction with the CBT experience itself and satisfaction with the impact of the CBT experience on their lives overall. (3) Satisfaction with the impact of CBT on life overall had a higher positive influence on revisit intention than did satisfaction with just the CBT experience. Furthermore, the results of analysis in this study are helpful to community associations or destination marketing organizations to create attractive experience activities. Ã‚Â© 2022 The Author(s).

442,"Relationships between relative weight, prey availability, and growth of walleyes in Oneida Lake, New York","Assessment of predator-prey dynamics is a central feature of community-based fisheries management, and a variety of fish condition indices have been developed from length-weight data to make inferences about feeding conditions. Relative weight (Wr) is useful for measuring fish condition, is easily calculated, and has simple data requirements; however, few studies have empirically validated Wr indices. We compared the W r of walleyes Sander vitreus in Oneida Lake, New York, with prey fish availability and walleye growth observed over 23 years (1961-1983). For each year, we calculated the Wr for three length-classes (350, 400, and 450 mm total length) of walleyes caught in October. Prey fish availability was calculated from annual estimates of (1) prey biomass in bottom trawl catch and (2) biomass of age-3 and older walleyes estimated from mark-recapture studies. Growth of walleyes (ages 4-6) was determined using lengths at age that were back-calculated from scale annuli. The Wr declined as walleye length-class increased, and Wr was positively related to both prey fish availability and walleye growth. Our study suggests that Wr can be a useful tool for describing feeding conditions and assessing predator-prey relations.

443,Collaborative research: An effective way to collect data for stock assessments and evaluate marine protected areas in California,"Collaborative fisheries research (in contrast to cooperative research) is based on the intellectual partnership between scientists and fishermen and is an effective way to collect data for stock assessments and to evaluate marine protected areas. Collaborative fisheries research is discussed in the context of comanagement of marine resources and how it contributes to a more democratic form of fisheries management. Many benefits result from working together, including (1) the incorporation of fishers' knowledge and expertise into the management process and (2) the development of shared perspectives derived through science-based investigations on the status of marine resources. The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program was formed in 2006 to participate in the monitoring of marine reserves established through California's Marine Life Protection Act.

In Maluku, eastern Indonesia, harvesting of coconut, sago, trepang, trochus, and reef fish is controlled by sasi, community-based resource management practices, under prior authorization by the head of local government. In Manus, Papua New Guinea, reefs are exclusively claimed and used by certain clan members. Disputes over reef ownership are resolved through either informal compromise between local groups or judgment in the local court, which gives customary practices top priority.

Several success measures were developed and analyzed in relation to a number of independent variables categorized as contextual or project intervention factors. Correlations between individual factors and the dependent variables are discussed. Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine the most important predictors of success. These included: population size of the community, a perceived crisis in terms of reduced fish populations, successful alternative income projects, high levels of participation in community decision making, continuing advice from the implementing organization and inputs from local government.

446,Marine Conservation Begins at Home: How a Local Community and Protection of a Small Bay Sent Waves of Change Around the UK and Beyond,"The Firth of Clyde, on the west coast of Scotland, was once one of the most productive fishing grounds in Europe. However, successive decades of poor management and overfishing led to a dramatic loss of biodiversity and the collapse of finfish fisheries. In response, concerned local residents on the Isle of Arran, which lies in the middle of the Clyde, formed the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) in 1995. After 13 years of campaigning, a small (2.67 km2) area in Lamlash Bay became ScotlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first no-take zone (NTZ) in 2008, and only the second in the UK. Since protection, biodiversity has increased substantially, along with the size, age and density of commercially important species such as the king scallop, Pecten maximus, and the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. Arguably more important, however, is the influence the Lamlash Bay NTZ and COAST have had on UK marine protection in general. Most notably, detailed research has created a case study that clearly demonstrates the benefits of protection in an area where little such evidence is available. This case has been used repeatedly to support efforts for increased protection of UK waters to help rebuild marine ecosystems and enhance their resilience in an uncertain future. In Scotland specifically, lobbying by COAST led to the designation of a much larger marine protected area (MPA, &gt;250 km2) around the south of Arran, one of 30 new MPAs in the country. Evidence from Lamlash Bay has supported development of strong protection for these MPAs, seeing off lobbyist efforts to weaken management. ArranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conservation success has been recognized internationally and is inspiring greater involvement of local communities around the UK, and further afield, to take the destiny of their coastal waters into their own hands. Successful marine conservation begins at home.

The establishment and maintenance of this MPA had five stages: (a) identification of community leaders who would participate in the project; (b) generation of consensus on the need to protect the reef through discussions among local stakeholders, NGOs and reef scientists; (c) involvement of government agencies in establishing the status of a MPA; (d) take-over of decision-making by centralized governmental agencies; and (e) continuous problem-solving process between the government and stakeholders. Over a 9-year period, the control of the MPA was taken over by government and stakeholders' participation downgraded from a decision-making to an advice-giving role. Government shortcomings to manage this MPA could be circumvented via collaborative co-management.

448,Effectiveness of a health promotion programme for farmers and fishermen with type-2 diabetes in Taiwan,"Aims. This paper is a report of a study examining the diabetes control and foot self-care capability in farmers and fishermen following introduction of a multi-stage, multi-disciplinary team and community-based small group health promotion programme. Background. Improving the control of diabetes is a critical issue in Taiwan because mortality rates are increasing dramatically, particularly in rural populations. Methods. A quasi-experimental research design was deployed from January to December 2009. A total of 387 participants living in nine rural districts with previous diagnoses of type-2 diabetes were randomly selected. Three hundred and twenty-three completed the 3-stage programme, including health assessment, health promotion education and individually tailored telephone counselling and evaluation over a 1-year period. Results. Most of the participants were fishermen or farmers who had <6years of education (79%) and were elders (68Ã‚Â·9Ã‚Â±9Ã‚Â·5years). Most of the physiological variables and foot self-care capabilities showed statistically significant improvement after the programme. Furthermore, 37 participants with severe high risk of diabetic foot accepted additional referral treatments, and their peripheral nerve and vascular functions improved. Conclusion. The research outcomes support the value of community-based health promotion programmes in rural areas, incorporating a multidisciplinary health team and culturally competent materials to help the elder rural inhabitants with diabetes enjoy better health and quality of life.

449,"Chenderoh Reservoir, Malaysia: The conservation and wise use of fish biodiversity in a small flow-through tropical reservoir","Chenderoh Reservoir on the Perak River, Malaysia, is a small tropical reservoir. Being a flow-through reservoir, the water-level management and retention time of the reservoir are dependent on the water management schemes of the three upper reservoirs. The fish biodiversity in the reservoir is relatively higher than that shown by areas downstream of the reservoir. Most species found in the downstream area are V strategists in contrast to those in the reservoir where 'K' strategist species are more abundant. Biodiversity is higher in the reservoir possibly due to the higher number of niches available through the inundation of the shoreline and the creation of various coves and bays. There is, however, a reduction in biodiversity in the reservoir over time. This reduction could be due to environmental perturbation caused by land-use activities along the shoreline of the reservoir. Although the fish standing stock is relatively low, small artisanal fisheries exist in the reservoir supporting the local communities. In order to maintain sustainability of the fisheries, the local fishers have been practising community-based management since the early 1980s and prior to the official enactment of the Perak State Fisheries Riverine Rules. In general, because of the sensitivity of tropical reservoirs to environmental perturbation as well as limited living space created by the existence of a permanent thermocline, tropical reservoirs should be properly managed so as to protect and maintain their biodiversity and sustainability through wise use of the aquatic resources.",NA,No,"The case study is based in Malaysia, which is not one of the countries of interest according to the SC."," No; The paper is clearly about a case study in Malaysia, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

450,Social media as a vehicle for user engagement with local history: A case study in the North East of Scotland,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine issues associated with user engagement on social media with local history in the North East of Scotland and to focus on a case study of the Buckie and District Fishing Heritage Society, a small but very successful and professionally-run community-based local heritage organisation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach using photo elicitation on social media was deployed in conjunction with analysis of the user interactions and the reach insights provided by Facebook to the page manager. Additionally, a focus group was used. Findings: The research, although focussed on an individual case study, offers significant lessons which are more widely applicable in the local history and cultural heritage social media domain. Key aspects include user engagement and how digital storytelling can assist in the documentation of local communities ultimately contributing to local history research and the broader cultural memory. The significance of the image and the photo elicitation methodology is also explored. Social implications: The research demonstrates new opportunities for engaging users and displaying historical content that can be successfully exploited by community heritage organisations. These are themes which will be developed within the paper. The research also demonstrates the value of photo elicitation in both historical and wider information science fields as a means of obtaining in-depth quality engagement and interaction with users and communities. Originality/value: The research explored the underutilised method of photo elicitation in a local history context with a community possessed of a strong sense of local identity. In addition to exploring the benefits of this method, it presents transferable lessons for how small, community-based history and heritage organisation can engage effectively with their audience.

451,Revisiting neoliberalism in the oceans: Governmentality and the biopolitics of Ã¢â‚¬ËœimprovementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the Irish and European fisheries,"FoucaultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account of the emergence of biopolitics in the late 18th century helps frame the political economy of Ã¢â‚¬ËœimprovementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as an environmental project linked to the well-being of the population. Since the 1970s, biopolitical concerns have shifted towards non-human populations and the reproduction of natural resources and ecosystems. This has become evident in the European fisheries, where after decades of exploitation greatly intensified since the 1960s, the extractive demands of the fishing industry have caught up with the reproductive capacities of most commercially targeted fish stocks. This contradiction has given rise to a new political economy of Ã¢â‚¬ËœimprovementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that seeks to sustain the biological health of commercially targeted fish populations while maintaining an economically profitable fishing industry. Central to this transition is the active role that fishers are expected to play in sustainably managing the fish stocks they exploit while adapting to Ã¢â‚¬ËœgreenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ market opportunities. Tradeable quota systems, eco-accreditation schemes and community-based resource management have all emerged as managerial strategies for inciting the active participation of fishers in this Ã¢â‚¬ËœcommonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ project of sustainable development. Drawing on FoucaultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective of governmentality, this paper argues that these strategies represent distinct but overlapping apparatuses of neoliberal governmentality that are representative of broader tendencies within environmental governance today.

453,A case study of community-based seasonally flooded ecosystem management in bangladesh: Proshika experience,"Bangladesh is a land of rivers, beels, floodplain, ponds and low-lying areas in which all categories of people are living in the surrounding periphery of these wetlands. The wetland ecosystem of Bangladesh is composed of 10,000 water-bodies or Jahmahals such as haors, baors, beels, rivers, seasonal floodplains, and streams. In Bangladesh about 140 million people are living within 147570 m areas. Out of 10.8 million ha rice area in Bangladesh about 1.40 million ha is seasonally flooded wetland areas, which is suitable for Boro, Amon or floating rice. In the rainy season when rain water comes from the upstream the wetlands are silted up and land becomes submerged, all community members have access to fishing in all the flooded areas because fish is the community property. But nobody cares to remove the silt and or stop silt entering the wetland. The poor people have limited access to natural resources, viz., wetland, land, etc. Proshika works for poverty alleviation since 1976 and provides different types of training, income generating activities and identified farmers-led management technologies for dissemination to the community people all over the country. Proshika adopted these community-based seasonally flooded wetland management techniques within the nine communities in four different agro-ecological and cultural zones in Bangladesh from 1998-2001. The projects were implemented with the collaboration of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI), and WorldFish Center funded by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). Proshika organized group members, including other stakeholders forming Project Implementation Committee (PIC), for sustainable management of seasonally flooded ecosystem.

454,Perceptions of ecosystem services and benefits to human well-being from community-based marine protected areas in Kenya,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) have historically been implemented and managed in a top-down way, excluding resource-dependent users from planning and management. In response to conflict and non-compliance, the governance of marine resources is increasingly embracing community-based approaches, assuming that by putting communities at the forefront of planning and management, participation will increase, causing positive social and ecological impacts. Given the relative newness of community-based MPAs, this study explores how resource users perceive their impacts on ecosystem services (ES) and human well-being (HWB). This study explores two community-based MPAs called tengefus in Kenya using mixed qualitative methods, including a participatory photography method called photovoice. Participation in and donor support for tengefus influences how resource users perceived tengefus and their impacts on ES and HWB. Individuals who were engaged in the tengefu from the inception or held official positions perceived more positive impacts on ES and HWB compared to those not as involved. Tengefus were often viewed by communities as attractors for external support and funding, positively influencing attitudes and feelings towards conservation. One site, the first tengefu in Kenya, had more external support and was surrounded by positive perceptions, while the other site had little external support and was surrounded by more conflict and mixed perceptions. This study exemplifies the complex social-political dynamics that MPAs create and are embedded within. Community-based MPA initiatives could benefit from ensuring widespread engagement throughout the inception, implementation and management, recognizing and managing expectations around donor support, and not assuming that benefits spillover throughout the community.

In their stead, the merits and shortcomings of a variety of alternate management systems, including individual transferable quotas, have been proposed, implemented, and analyzed. Few investigations, however, have examined actual fishers' preferences for different management systems. Integrating results from a mail survey of North Carolina commercial fishers with their individual harvest histories and sociodemographic profiles shows that economic and cultural variables both play a significant role in management system preference. The analysis introduces the use of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a measure of investment diversity, as a measure of diversity in fisheries harvests and demonstrates an association with management preferences.

Starting from these questions we describe possible forms of LFM for Swedish coastal fishery supported by recent research. The biological and social preconditions for restructuring fisheries management are derived from an analysis of the ecological and managerial situation in Swedish fishery. Three types of LFM - owner based, user based, and community based management - are analyzed with regard to the tasks to be carried out in LFM, the roles of management groups, and the definition and optimal size of management areas.

This paper examines two fisheries co-management programs, American Samoa's Community-based Fisheries Management Program (CFMP) and Hawai'i's Community-based Subsistence Fisheries Area (CBSFA) legislation, using a framework of design principles derived from common property theory. The two programs provide an interesting contrast; while American Samoa's CFMP program has been successfully implemented in eleven communities, the Hawai'i program has struggled, with no CBSFA fully implemented for over 20 years. The purpose of this analysis is threefold: to utilize the design principles to assess the likelihood that a given fisheries co-management program will have a successful outcome; to test the design principles to determine how well these principles can serve as predictors for the outcomes seen in these two different programs; and to develop recommendations for how these design principles might be used to strengthen these two programs, as well as improve other fisheries co-management programs and policies in the future. The analysis reveals that the design principles provide a useful framework through which to assess co-management programs. Our analysis reveals that the principles can provide important insights for understanding the differential outcomes of the two programs as well as provide guidance for how these and other programs can be strengthened in the future.

458,Narrative assemblages for power-balanced coastal and marine governance. Tara Bandu as a tool for community-based fisheries co-management in Timor-Leste,"Poverty alleviation and resource governance are inextricably related. Mainstream resource management has been typically criticized by social scientists for the inherent power imbalances between fishery managers and small-scale fishing communities. Yet, while a number of mechanisms of collective action to address these power imbalances have been developed, they remain undertheorized. This paper builds upon first-hand experience of the authors in assisting the community of Biacou to strengthen the resource management role of a local ban called Tara bandu, as well as a qualitative study conducted one year after its implementation. Our argument is fourfold. First, we suggest that in geographies where mainstream resource management cannot be implemented, strengthening custom-based institutions in hybrid mechanisms provides an opportunity to promote a more sustainable use of coastal and marine resources in a cost-effective manner. Second, by analyzing the different narratives that were embedded in the process, we argue that community-based fisheries co-management can benefit from creating narrative assemblages. Third, we explore how the principles of agnosticism, generalized symmetry, and free association can be integrated in the work of fisheries managers to neutralize power imbalances with fishing communities. Fourth, we contribute to the current conceptualization of hybrid organizations in fisheries co-management.

459,Reliability of community-based data monitoring in the Olifants River estuary (South Africa),"The promulgation of new fisheries policies and laws in South Africa in the late 1990s has provided opportunities for historically disadvantaged communities to access resources that were unequally distributed in the past. The Marine Living Resources Act of 1998, is one such piece of legislation that aims to create more equitable access to marine resources. However, research suggests that post-apartheid policy and legal reform in the fisheries sector have neglected artisanal fishers. This sector is still restricted in their access to fisheries resources, and their input into management, particularly with regard to their role as partners in the assessment, monitoring and management of resources, has been largely overlooked. In this paper, the analysis of information generated by a community-based monitoring program in a gillnet fishery on the Olifants River (Western Cape, South Africa) confirms the value of involving local fishers in the collection and analysis of data related to their fishing activities. Results demonstrated that: (1) Fisheries data collected by community-based monitors are reliable and can make a useful contribution to management decisions; (2) 63% of the target species captured are mature fish and the resource appears to be sustainably exploited; and (3) the incidental catch is negligible. Furthermore, the results provide useful information that might influence government policy proposals to implement a total ban on gillnetting in all South African estuaries.

461,Voodoo versus fishing committees: The role of traditional and contemporary institutions in fisheries management,"We study the co-existence of two community-based institutions for fisheries management in Benin: a traditional institution embedded in the Voodoo religion and a recent secular institution in the form of fishing committees. Using household survey data on fishing activities, we find that rules of both institutions have a statistically significant but small impact on the use of unsustainable fishing gear. We further find that Voodoo fishers who break the traditional Voodoo-based rule follow the fishing committee rule to the same extent as other fishers. This finding is consistent with a possible transition from the traditional Voodoo-based institution to the secular fishing committee institution. More research is needed to fully assess the effectiveness of, and interactions between, the two institutions.

462,The peri-urban interface: Approaches to sustainable natural and human resource use,"Peri-urban interfaces-the zones where urban and rural areas meet-suffer from the greatest problems to humans caused by rapid urbanization, including intense pressures on resources, slum formation, lack of adequate services such as water and sanitation, poor planning and degradation of farmland. These areas, home to hundreds of millions of people, face unique problems and need distinctive and innovative approaches and solutions. This book, authored by top researchers and practitioners, covers the full breadth and depth of the impacts of rapid urbanization on livelihoods, poverty and resources in the peri-urban zones in diverse African, Asian, Latin American and Caribbean contexts. Topics include peri-urban resource sustainability, ecosystems and societies and environmental changes in peri-urban zones. Rich case studies cover production systems and livelihoods including the impacts of irrigated vegetable production, horticulture, dairy enterprises, waste-fed fisheries and pastoral livelihoods. Also addressed are planning and development issues in the peri-urban interface including the difficulty in achieving sustainability, conflict and cooperation over resources, and a fresh look at the relationship between people and their environment. The final part of the book presents policies and strategies for promoting and measuring sustainability in peri-urban zones including community-based waste management, the co-management of watersheds and empowerment of the poor. This book is the most comprehensive examination of the challenges and solutions facing the people and environments of peri-urban zones and is essential reading for all practitioners, students and academics in geography and development.

463,"Past, present and future of fishery management on one of the world's last remaining pristine great lakes: Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada","Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada supports important sport and aboriginal-subsistence fisheries and is among the last remaining pristine great lakes of the world. The lake's unique ecology is characterized by a harsh subarctic climate, low productivity and species diversity, and high intraspecific diversity of lake trout. These aspects in combination with geographical remoteness present special challenges to the management of two exceptionally different fisheries. The history of its management has not been well documented or reviewed; therefore, our objectives in this paper were to summarize the history and status of Great Bear Lake's fisheries and their management, and to identify gaps in knowledge, future challenges, and actions required to meet those challenges. Prior to 1970, management goals for the lake had not been established formally, and harvest numbers and biological characteristics of fish were unknown. To reduce data gaps, creel surveys, gillnet assessments, fish tagging, and subsistence monitoring were implemented. During the 1980s, Canada established the management goal of conserving a high quality sport fishery, while protecting aboriginal access to the subsistence fishery. On the basis of assessment data, lodge harvest quotas, lodge guest capacity limits, individual angler harvest limits, and angler licensing were among the management actions taken to achieve that goal. Since 2005, decision making has been guided by the ""water heart,"" a management plan for Great Bear Lake. Management has since evolved into a complex co-management system among aboriginal, territorial, and federal governments. Changes in regulations, sport trophy and tourism industries, subsistence resource use, and social and cultural norms and practices contributed to changes in the Great Bear Lake fishery and its management. In the future, anthropogenic and climate change are the two main challenges facing co-management of the lake's resources. We recommend the adoption of an ecosystem approach to management, establishment of a fishery technical committee, reformulation of the current plan, explicit commitment to evaluation, conducting community-based monitoring, and development and use of a joint strategic plan among co-managers to describe how to interact and implement the Great Bear Lake management plan.

466,Fisheries management influences phytoplankton biomass of Amazonian floodplain lakes,"Tropical floodplains secure the protein supply of millions of people, but only sound management can ensure the long-term continuity of such ecosystem services. Overfishing is a widespread threat to multitrophic systems, but how it affects ecosystem functioning is poorly understood, particularly in tropical freshwater food webs. Models based on temperate lakes frequently assume that primary producers are mostly bottom-up controlled by nutrient and light limitations, with negligible effects of top-down forces. Yet this assumption remains untested in complex tropical freshwater systems experiencing marked spatiotemporal variation. We use consolidated community-based fisheries management practices and spatial zoning to test the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down drivers of phytoplankton biomass, controlling for the influence of local to landscape heterogeneity. Our study focuses on 58 large Amazonian floodplain lakes under different management regimes that resulted in a gradient of apex-predator abundance. These lakes, distributed along ~600Ã‚Â km of a major tributary of the Amazon River, varied widely in size, structure, landscape context, and hydrological seasonality. Using generalised linear models, we show that community-based fisheries management, which controls the density of apex predators, is the strongest predictor of phytoplankton biomass during the dry season, when lakes become discrete landscape units. Water transparency also emerges as an important bottom-up factor, but phosphorus, nitrogen and several lake and landscape metrics had minor or no effects on phytoplankton biomass. During the wet-season food pulse, when lakes become connected to adjacent water bodies and homogenise the landscape, only lake depth explained phytoplankton biomass. Synthesis and applications. Tropical freshwaters fisheries typically assume that fish biomass is controlled by bottom-up mechanisms, so that overexploitation of large predators would not affect overall ecosystem productivity. Our results, however, show that top-down forces are important drivers of primary productivity in tropical lakes, above and beyond the effects of bottom-up factors. This helps us to understand the enormous success of community-based Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfishing agreementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the Amazon. Multiple stakeholders should embrace socio-ecological management practices that shape both bottom-up and top-down forces to ensure biodiversity protection, sustainable fisheries yields and food security for local communities and regional economies.

467,An introduction to Japanese and French fisheries,"Fisheries and aquaculture in Japan and France are very different in terms of scale and management schemes. Japan has developed a unique mixed system of community-based coastal management and licensing schemes for off-shore and distant-water fisheries, Increasing demand, changes in consumption and the heavy constraint of access limitation to third countries' waters, make Japan more and more dependent on imports. Though few effort and access-limitation schemes are implemented locally in France, most of the management rules comply with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The basic lines are the technical measures, the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) allocated to quotas at the regional level, and the reduction of the fleet size in accordance with the Multiannual Guidance Programme. Fleet reduction to increase productivity and stabilization of fishermen's incomes are the main objectives for the coming years.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's (UNESCO) has included Langkawi's 99 islands in its global geopark network. One of the most popular geopark sites in Langkawi is Kilim Karst, originally developed as a fishing community under the management of the Kilim Community Cooperative Society (KCCS). Following Kilim's recognition as a geopark, the role of the KCCS has evolved to encompass the management of local geotourism activities, ensuring that the community's involvement is consistent with UNESCO's sustainable development benchmarks. This study discusses the role played by geoparks and geotourism in the cooperative community entrepreneurship of local populations. Using the interview method, the authors consider the role of community-based entrepreneurships in developing geotourism in Kilim. With the full cooperation of the local government, the KCCS helps to develop local entrepreneurs who lack fundamental business knowledge. The authors review the performance of the KCCS based on their 2011-2014 annual general meeting report. The results of this review, coupled with the growing number of tourists, reveal the success of the KCCS' commitment to supporting local entrepreneurship.

469,The promise of community - based fishery resource management,"Environmental change may pose threats to the ecosystems of natural resources such as the fisheries. It may affect the renewability of the resources which in turn affects the livelihoods of local communities relying on those resources unless managed soundly. To understand how sound management of the fishery resources could be achieved together with the fishermen community, this paper analyses the sensibility of a community-based management of the natural ecosystem as a means to enhance the economic wellbeing of local small-scale fishermen. Two case studies were conducted in Malaysia for this purpose wherein the success factors of the community based fishery resource management projects (the Komuniti Pengurusan Sumber Perikanan or KPSP) initiated by the Malaysian Department of Fishery were scrutinised. It was found that the main reason for the projects' success was the existence of an implementation will to redress the triple problems of legal ownership, access to ecosystems and political marginalization of the fishermen. In conclusion, the KPSP model represented approaches worthy of further emulation in the developing world although further research would show the way how the model could be improved and customised according to the unique contexts of other fishermen communities.

470,Fishing for Power: Incursions of the Ugandan Authoritarian State,"A few months before UgandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2016 presidential elections, the government issued an executive order dissolving community-based Beach Management Units, the local and democratic governance bodies responsible for managing fishing activities. The official narrative cited rampant corruption and the exploitation of UgandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s valuable fishing resources as justification for the suspension. A popular counternarrative, howeverÃ¢â‚¬â€told in carrying whispers at fishing landing sites around Lake VictoriaÃ¢â‚¬â€painted the order as President MuseveniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempt to secure votes during a tough presidential campaign. Drawing on seven months of ethnographic research on fisheries management in Uganda and critical studies on the nexus of coloniality, securitization, and common pool resource theories, this article analyzes sociopolitical narratives around fisheries governance a year before and after the presidential elections in Uganda. The author illustrates how recent policy changes in the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fisheries governance sector are underlined by a powerful narrative of peace and security and argues that the political intervention can be interpreted as efforts by the national government to secure the ruling eliteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increasingly authoritarian hold on state power.

471,"Climate change impacts outweigh conservation efforts in coral reefs that are highly exposed to thermal stresses in Zanzibar, Tanzania","With a greater range of management practices and so many threats to coral reefs, assessing coral reef resilience using social-ecological approaches is an important way towards understanding the climatic and non-climatic impacts, and proper conservation efforts in coral reefs. In this study, six reefs (Changuu, Chapwani, Chumbe, Kizimkazi, Mnemba East and Mnemba West) were selected as case study sites to explore resilience potential of coral reefs in Zanzibar in relation to contrasting conservation strategies. Data were collected through household surveys, key informant interviews and biological survey (line-intercept transect and direct observations). Results showed that, Chumbe reefs was perceived to be highly protected followed by Kizimkazi reefs, while Changuu and Chapwani were considered to be less protected. Fishing pressure, climate change, inadequate management and pollution were regarded as the most critical drivers of coral reefs degradation. Coral bleaching was identified to be a main cause of coral reef damage by communities in Chumbe and Mnemba East, whereas inadequate management, pollution and uncontrolled tourisms were identified as the major driver by those in Changuu and Chapwani. Overall, reefs from Kizimkazi was found to have the highest resilience potential as it is under community-based conservation compared to other reefs. We conclude that coral reef resilience is context-specific and influenced by multiple factors, and although conservation efforts have a positive impact on coral reef health, climate change effects outweigh conservation efforts in reefs that are highly exposed to thermal stresses, such as the Chumbe and Mnemba East reefs. We recommend further promotion of viable alternative livelihood activities to reef reliant communities and collaborative management for the improvement of corals' resilience and conservation in the study area.

This finding confirms that womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s share of asset explicitly increase women autonomy not to allocate the budget share on adult goods expenditure which is identical to male domination. WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s share of assets also has positive and substantial effect on richer nutrients expenditure such as meat and fish and dairy products.

473,Establishment of Community Managed FisheriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Closures in Kenya: Early Evolution of the Tengefu Movement,"Community-based management (CBM) could be an essential tool to prevent the depletion of marine resources in the Western Indian Ocean region. In Kenya, political pressure to strengthen local governance, has led to adoption of CBM as a way of reducing over-exploitation and managing the competing uses and impacts on the marine environment. Several communities in Kenya have embraced CBM and have set aside or closed previously fished areas to enhance recovery of fisheries and biodiversity. These community fisheries closures (locally called tengefu), despite being degraded, may recover to finfish abundances and biodiversity levels similar to established MPAs or above thresholds for maintaining some ecological services. Communities see their direct involvement and control of these tengefu as more likely to result in benefits flowing directly to them. Community closures are also important for articulating and resolving community values and strengthening their management capacity. Here, we describe the evolution of the tengefu movement in Kenya and combine information from focus group discussions, interviews, underwater surveys and boundary marking to evaluate the current status, opportunities and challenges facing these tengefu. We show that in some cases community closures suffer from slow and incomplete national and local legislative processes, challenges to compliance, and weak management.

474,Ã¢â‚¬Å“AcceptableÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“unacceptableÃ¢â‚¬Â poachers: Lessons in managing poaching from the Galician shellfish sector,"One of the salient features of shellfish poaching in Galicia (NW Spain) is that in certain cases the illegal extraction of shellfish is tolerated by licensed users of this resource. Since the Galician shellfish industry operates on a co-management basis the differentiation between Ã¢â‚¬Å“acceptableÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“unacceptableÃ¢â‚¬Â poachers will impact both the management of the activity and the fight against poaching. The main objective of this study was to reveal in what circumstances and under what conditions shellfish poaching is tolerated by Galician shellfish-harvesting communities, noting its implications for political action. The conclusion was that Ã¢â‚¬Å“acceptableÃ¢â‚¬Â poaching is associated with i) poachers being members of the community of licensed shellfish harvesters and ii) the harvesting of shellfish is either for self-consumption or performed by people acknowledged by the community to be financially hard-pressed and needy. In management terms, this tolerance of a certain kind of poacher required the introduction of informal community-based arrangements that made it possible to find pragmatic solutions to the problems of poaching, which in some cases resulted in a collective benefit for the shellfish-harvesting communities concerned. The raw data used in this study was obtained by performing 55 surveys and 48 in-depth interviews with leading members of fishermen's associations.

These fishers provided data that we used to map the extent of each of the fishing grounds, to weight the relative importance of areas within the grounds, to characterize the operating costs of each fishery, and to analyze the potential economic losses associated with proposed marine protected areas. A regional stakeholder group used the maps and impact analyses in conjunction with other data sets to iteratively identify economic and ecological trade-offs in designations of different areas as MPAs at regional, port, and fishery extents. Their final proposed MPA network designated 20% of state waters as MPAs. Potential net economic loss ranged from 1.7% to 14.2% in the first round of network design and totaled 6.3% in the final round of design. This process is a case study in the application of spatial analysis to validate and integrate local stakeholder knowledge in marine planning.

478,An institutional development process in community based coastal resource management: building the capacity and opportunity for community based co-management in a small-scale fisheries community,"The term Community Based Coastal Resource Management (CB-CRM) is used to describe localized co-management systems wherein small-scale fisherfolk take up a dominant role in fisheries management. In this paper, a description is given of the development process for the establishment of such a community based co-management system, as it gradually evolved in the course of a CB-CRM project. The development process of a municipal federation of small-scale fisherfolk organizations in a semi-urban area in the Philippines is described and analyzed in five phases. It is concluded that progress in this CB-CRM project depended largely on local institutional development processes in the community.

479,Is MSC eco-labelling workable in Taiwan? Responses from various sectors of the Taiwanese sergestid shrimp fishery,"Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) eco-labelling is among the widely known market-based management approaches that are considered effective in solving the problem of overfishing. The approach has been applied in several marine capture fisheries worldwide; however, it was found not to be fully workable in many fisheries for various reasons. The sergestid shrimp (Sergia lucens) fishery in Tungkang County of Taiwan has been managed well in recent decades through a bottom-up community-based co-management scheme and is probably the best candidate for obtaining the first MSC certification in Taiwan. This study assessed the fishery in relation to the three principles of MSC eco-labelling and investigated responses from experts, managers, industry representatives, and consumers on improving the fishery in order to obtain the MSC certification. The results suggested that three major problems confronted the fishery: (1) the fishery was unlikely to meet the MSC standards unless it could reduce its high bycatch rate; (2) the economic and/or political benefits were not attractive enough to the relevant sectors for them to cover the high costs and responsibility of obtaining and maintaining the MSC certification; and (3) the fishery was reputed to be well managed without any eco-label, suggesting no strong incentive to obtain one from a management perspective. The benefits of MSC eco-labelling could be consolidated, however, and the role of government was crucial in this regard.

480,Understanding the Scale of Marine Protection in Hawai'i: From Community-Based Management to the Remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands,"Ancient Hawaiians developed a sophisticated natural resource management system that included various forms of spatial management. Today there exists in Hawai'i a variety of spatial marine management strategies along a range of scales, with varying degrees of effectiveness. State-managed no-take areas make up less than 0.4% of nearshore waters, resulting in limited ecological and social benefits. There is increasing interest among communities and coastal stakeholders in integrating aspects of customary Hawaiian knowledge into contemporary co-management. A network of no-take reserves for aquarium fish on Hawai'i Island is a stakeholder-driven, adaptive management strategy that has been successful in achieving ecological objectives and economic benefits. A network of large-scale no-take areas for deepwater (100-400. m) bottomfishes suffered from a lack of adequate data during their initiation; however, better technology, more ecological data, and stakeholder input have resulted in improvements and the ecological benefits are becoming clear. Finally, the PapahÃ„ÂnaumokuÃ„Âkea Marine National Monument (PMNM) is currently the single largest conservation area in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. It is considered an unqualified success and is managed under a new model of collaborative governance. These case studies allow an examination of the effects of scale on spatial marine management in Hawai'i and beyond that illustrate the advantages and shortcomings of different management strategies.

481,"Post-filling phase ichthyofaunal community and fishery potential of Chitsuwa Reservoir, a small tropical reservoir in Zimbabwe","Many small reservoirs exist throughout Southern Africa, and with adequate management have the potential to contribute significantly to food security. The fisheries and limnology of the newly created Chitsuwa Reservoir in Zimbabwe were studied with the objective of generating information to support the development, management and sustainable use of fisheries to enhance the socio-economic status of riparian communities. Based on gill nets of various mesh sizes, it was confirmed that the reservoir is presently inhabited by a fairly diverse fish community comprising ten species belonging to five families (Clarias gariepinus; Coptodon rendalli; Labeo cylindricus; Marcusenius macrolepidotus; Micropterus salmoides; Momyrus longirostris; Oreochromis mossambicus; Oreochromis niloticus; Serranochromis microcephalus; and Tilapia sparrmanii). Oreochromis niloticus dominated the reservoir with respect to both abundance, biomass and catch. The index of relative importance revealed O.Ã‚Â niloticus and M.Ã‚Â macrolepidotus were the most important species. Results from the Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed a clear division of the fish species that followed the environmental variables. Although fisheries may benefit from the invasive M.Ã‚Â salmoides and the established O.Ã‚Â niloticus, their presence in the reservoir is a cause for concern for conserving native congeneric species that risk extirpation through documented mechanisms. The results of the present study suggest sound management of the reservoir is required to raise its potential of supporting the livelihoods of the surrounding communities with a predicted annual fish yield of 61.5Ã‚Â t/year. Management of this reservoir should involve the local communities, empowering them so that they practice sustainable non-destructive fishing methods.

482,A review of anthropogenic interaction and impact characteristics of the Sundaic mangroves in Southeast Asia,"The mangroves of the Sundaic biogeography region in Southeast Asia are ecologically diverse and highly productive. The location of mangroves close to densely populated coastlines, on the other hand, puts them in a perilous situation as socio-economic growth has intensified in the past decades. Thus, research to support conservation of remnant mangroves is urgently required. Critical information is, however, spread across numerous disciplines. Here, we use a range of sources to gain multidisciplinary inputs from as much literature as possible to summarize emerging trends for driving future research to support conservation. This narrative review begins by pointing out the unique values of the biophysical and ecosystem services of Sundaic mangroves. Subsequently, the human beneficiaries of the mangroves are explored, including indigenous sea-people who are rarely mentioned in the literature. To put mangrove degradation and loss into context, past and emerging anthropogenic pressures are evaluated to identify the threats. Key findings include the presence of persistent threats from the agriculture and aquaculture sectors. These are to be expected, but alarmingly, coal-fired power plants and inland hydrological shifts induced by dams also pose major concerns. Although community-based management is often hailed as part of the solution, studies argue that the approach should be attempted cautiously. The latest body of knowledge revealed herein is vital to inform coastal environment management and further drives the direction of research in the Sundaic and other systems globally in which similar socio-economic pressures are experienced.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the potentials of co-management as an alternative fisheries management strategy for the countries in the CARICOM region.

485,Movements of a deep-water fish: Establishing marine fisheries management boundaries in coastal Arctic waters,"Management boundaries that define populations or stocks of fish form the basis of fisheries planning. In the Arctic, decreasing sea ice extent is driving increasing fisheries development, highlighting the need for ecological data to inform management. In Cumberland Sound, southwest Baffin Island, an indigenous community fishery was established in 1987 targeting Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) through the ice. Following its development, the Cumberland Sound Management Boundary (CSMB) was designated and a total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to the fishery. The CSMB was based on a sink population of Greenland halibut resident in the northern section of the Sound. Recent fishing activities south of the CSMB, however, raised concerns over fish residency, the effectiveness of the CSMB and the sustainability of the community-based winter fishery. Through acoustic telemetry monitoring at depths between 400 and 1200 m, and environmental and fisheries data, this study examined the movement patterns of Greenland halibut relative to the CSMB, the biotic and abiotic factors driving fish movement and the dynamics of the winter fishery. Greenland halibut undertook clear seasonal movements between the southern and northern regions of the Sound driven by temperature, dissolved oxygen, and sea ice cover with most fish crossing the CSMB on an annual basis. Over the lifespan of the fishery, landfast ice cover initially declined and then became variable, limiting accessibility to favored fisher locations. Concomitantly, catch per unit effort declined, reflecting the effect of changing ice conditions on the location and effort of the fishery. Ultimately, these telemetry data revealed that fishers now target less productive sites outside of their favored areas and, with continued decreases in ice, the winter fishery might cease to exist. In addition, these novel telemetry data revealed that the CSMB is ineffective and led to its relocation to the entrance of the Sound in 2014. The community fishery can now develop an open-water fishery in addition to the winter fishery to exploit the TAC, which will ensure the longevity of the fishery under projected climate-change scenarios. Telemetry shows great promise as a tool for understanding deep-water species and for directly informing fisheries management of these ecosystems that are inherently complex to study.

This paper examines the implementation of MAR programs in Batu Belah village of Anambas islands marine recreational park, Riau islands province. The structured household survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted along with field observation during December 2018. The descriptive analysis applied to understand community knowledge, acceptance, participation, and perception on the current of marine environmental conditions, while the Analytic Network Process (ANP) used to identify problems and best strategies to improve future actions. Community knowledge and participation in MAR programs are at a moderate level, while community acceptance of MAR programs is at a high level. They mostly responded that the coastal environment is in better condition compared to previous years. Overall, the level of community perception in Batu Belah about the MAR program is in the moderate level category.

488,Governance analysis of a community managed small-scale crab fishery in Madagascar: novel use of an empirical framework,"The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) framework was developed to offer a structured, empirical approach for analysing governance and has been applied to marine prottabected areas (MPAs) around the world. This study sees the novel application of the MPAG framework to a small-scale mangrove crab fishery in northwest Madagascar. The country typifies developing country environmental governance challenges, due to its poverty, political instability and lack of state capacity, with bottom-up approaches often identified as a potential solution. In this context, small-scale fisheries (SSF) play a vital role in food security and poverty alleviation but are vulnerable to over-exploitation. The case study examines community-based management, including the role of three nascent fishing association managing portions of the fishery, within a mangrove ecosystem. Despite issues with underrepresentation of fishers in local resource management organizations that have partial responsibility for the mangrove habitats, some management measures and incentives have been applied, including the replantation of mangroves and fishery-wide gear restrictions. However, the analysis highlights market forces and migration are drivers with negative synergistic effects that cannot be controlled by bottom-up management. Incentives identified as needed or in need or strengthening require the support of external actors, the state, industry and or NGO(s). Thus, governance approaches should seek integration and move away from polarised solutions (top-down vs- bottom-up). As shown by other MPAG case studies, effective governance is dependent on achieving Ã¢â‚¬Ëœresilience through diversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, in terms of the diversity of both the actors and the incentives they are able to collectively employ.

Progress in the Salish Sea (Strait of Georgia) of British Columbia has been slow. Opposition by First Nations is a factor as these protected areas have the potential to impact on Aboriginal rights. This case study with the Hul'qumi'num First Nations examines their approaches to marine conservation and their perspectives on ""no-take zones"" as a component of marine conservation. The study used a variety of community engagement procedures including relationship building, hiring of a Hul'qumi'num research assistant, conducting individual interviews, focus groups, and field surveys. Interviews were conducted with 41 participants contacted because of their knowledge and interest in marine resource use. The views reported provide a rich understanding of Hul'qumi'num attitudes, but cannot be generalised to the whole population. There was widespread support for efforts to involve local First Nations communities in the development of management plans for marine resources, and also for recognition of First Nation reliance on marine resources for food, social, and ceremonial needs and for economic development opportunities. The establishment of permanent no-take zones was met with both opposition and support. The most highly endorsed statement about no-take zones is one of principle-that they are a violation of Aboriginal rights. However, there was also strong agreement that permanent no-take zones would help reduce over-fishing. The National Marine Conservation Area program is in its infancy and it remains to be seen how the ""strictly protected"" zone of the legislation will be interpreted in relationship to Aboriginal harvesting practices. However it is clear that successful conservation will only occur with Aboriginal consent in many areas and there needs to be greater investment in understanding Aboriginal perspectives on marine conservation.

Due to increasing demand and price for the bivalves has motivated the Sabah Fisheries Department to support mud clam aquaculture among the communities living close to mangrove areas. This study surveyed the quantity and size of mud clams collected from two locations in Kudat district from in January to March 2017. The mangroves at Kimihang is a natural area where locals collect mud clams while the aquaculture centre in Kampung Kopunadan is run by the community.. The collected mud clams were grouped as small (< 50 mm), medium (50mm to 70 mm) and large (>70 mm). This study found that the outer mud clam shell size collected in Kampung Kopunadan is larger than the wild type from Kimihang. From the surveys and interviews, it is discovered that the majority of locals in Kimihang prefer to consume small clams while Kopunadan locals prefer large ones. The respondents who liked small clams said the flesh is easier to chew, while the ones who chose large-sized clams cited more quantity of flesh. Majority of the respondents are from the Rungus ethnic group, who are low-income earners depending on the fisheries sector as their livihood.

494,CASE STUDY: Community based ecological mangrove rehabilitation (CBEMR) in Indonesia from small (12-33 ha) to medium scales (400 ha) with pathways for adoption at larger scales (> 5000 ha),"While successful examples of large-scale (5 000-10 000 ha) ecological wetland/mangrove rehabilitation projects exist worldwide, mangrove rehabilitation efforts in Indonesia, both large and small, have mainly failed. The majority of projects (both government programs and non-government initiatives) have oversimplified the technical processes of mangrove rehabilitation, favouring the direct planting of a restricted subset of mangrove species (from the family Rhizophoracea), commonly in the lower half of the intertidal system (from Mean Sea Level down to Lowest Atmospheric Tide) where mangroves, by and large, do not naturally grow. Aside from lack of appropriate technical assessment, these lower inter-tidal mudflats are often targeted for rehabilitation because true degraded mangrove forests are frequently linked to tenurial issues that require significant effort and investment to resolve. Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (EMR) has been implemented and well documented for the past several decades in New World mangrove systems (Lewis, 2005, 2009b) and was selected as a best practice for adaptation and trials in Indonesia. Whereas in the US, the five-step process primarily focuses on biophysical assessments and eco-hydrological repair, when applied to the Indonesian scenario, EMR requires both lower-cost biophysical approaches and greater attention to socio-cultural-political approaches common in sustainable development and coastal resource management programs. The adaptation of EMR was initially tested in small-scale projects, ranging from 12-33 ha in sites from the islands of Sumatera and Sulawesi. Biophysical adaptations included use of low-cost biophysical assessment methods, reliance on manual labour, strategic breaching of aquaculture ponds dike walls, manual construction of tidal channels, and human assisted propagule dispersal while socio-political adaptations included land tenure settlement, increased use of training of trainers programs, gender assessments and sensitisation, enhanced community organising, coordination with numerous government agencies and participatory monitoring. Initial projects succeeded in rehabilitating mangrove coverage and diversity, while catalysing community-based or collaborative management. The most recent Community Based Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (CBEMR) project took place on Tanakeke Island, South Sulawesi, where 1776 ha of mangroves were reduced to approximately 576 ha over two decades due to development of 1200 ha of aquaculture ponds. At least 800 ha of ponds on the island were disused as of the start of a four-year project to restore 400 ha at a cost of US$590,000 and initiate adaptive collaborative management. Local communities from six villages willingly made their ponds available for rehabilitation, as their main livelihood had switched to seaweed mariculture and they recognised the urgent need to restore mangrove coverage for fisheries value and storm protection. The initial site restored (43 ha) has naturally recruited to an average density of 2171 stems/ha., 32 months after initial restoration. Three more recent sites have already demonstrated natural recruitment between 767-1450 seedlings within 7-10 months after restoration. Local communities have developed mangrove management groups and regulations for both remnant mangrove forests and rehabilitation areas, which have been acknowledged at higher levels of government. The implementation of gender analyses, gender sensitisation and the development of Womangrove groups have been crucial to ensure the equal involvement of women in the process of mangrove rehabilitation and management. The process of CBEMR at this point is being considered for upscaling and replication, and has been included as a best practice in both the South Sulawesi Provincial and Indonesian National Mangrove Strategies. The CBEMR process has been recommended by the Ministry of Forests - Natural and Protected Forest Management Agency (PHKA) as a requisite practice to restore the 4000 ha in the Tanjung Panjang Nature Reserve in Gorontalo Province, which nearly completely and illegally converted to aquaculture ponds over the past two decades. CBEMR and strategic breaching is also being considered for restoration in Indonesia's largest contiguous converted mangrove forest, which includes 60 000 ha of largely abandoned and disused shrimp ponds in the Mahakam Delta, East Kalimantan. The proven effectiveness of the CBEMR process at small and medium scales relies on its ability to resolve both biophysical and socio-political issues underscoring mangrove forest degradation in Indonesia. If and when this is applied to large-scale restoration, it is sure that continued attention will need to be paid to both biophysical and socio-political approaches.

495,Women and fisheries co-management: Limits to participation on Lake Victoria,"Despite women making up about half of the global fisheries workforce, it is believed that women are much less involved in community-based fisheries management than men. There is, however, limited evidence available on the extent and nature of their involvement. This paper responds to the gap by asking how representation of women is working in fisheries co-management, what the effects of their representation and participation are and by identifying constraints on their effective participation. Lake Victoria, East Africa, is an example of a fisheries co-management system with a quota set for the minimum inclusion of women in community-based structures. Research undertaken in the three countries bordering the lake, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, found that participation of women in fisheries co-management committees has generally been accepted at the landing site level. The participation of women allows different networks to be represented and reached and examples were given of advocacy and initiatives to strengthen women's livelihoods through representation in co-management committees. However, although the quota system was often complied with, and support for women's participation expressed, the effective participation of women is limited by prevailing gendered norms and relations.

496,Community champions of ecosystem services: The role of local agency in protecting Indonesian coral reefs,"The importance of communities is well recognized in the protection and enhancement of ecosystem services (ES), yet the influences of individuals within and on communities are often overlooked. Individual and community agency are pertinent in small-scale fisheries, given that livelihoods of many millions of these fishers worldwide depend on ES derived from coral reefs and seagrass beds. In eastern Indonesia the rapid spread of destructive fishing practices has serious impacts on these marine and coastal ecosystems. Policy is complex, with three levels of government involved, and communities also seeking to apply customary marine management and fishing rules. Effective deterrence and enforcement prove difficult for both communities and government, especially in remote places. Community-based marine protected areas, and government or aid-led educational programs, are attempted, but are insufficient against the pressures of well-organized illegal fishing supply chains. On Selayar Island, in South Sulawesi province, Indonesia, certain local Ã¢â‚¬Å“champions,Ã¢â‚¬Â fishers and others exerting influence within their communities, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“island champions (IC),Ã¢â‚¬Â individuals working at island level from local government and non-government roles, are developing their ownÃ¢â‚¬â€often unorthodoxÃ¢â‚¬â€strategies to mobilize social change to protect ES. Through in-depth interviews supported by participant observation we investigated how these individuals become motivated, and how they operate to protect local ecosystems such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows. We document what inspired them, what strategies they follow, their observations on barriers, and their key messages for others. Understanding these very unofficial, individual and small-group processes that occur outside conventional policy-making and ecosystem governance can allow sharing of effective strategies to encourage potential champions elsewhere, and support community agency in protecting marine ES.

497,Community-based climate change adaptation strategies for integrated prawn-fish-rice farming in Bangladesh to promote social-ecological resilience,"Farming freshwater prawns with fish in rice fields is widespread in the coastal region of southwest Bangladesh because of favourable resources and ecological conditions. This article provides an overview of an ecosystem-based approach to integrated prawn-fish-rice farming in southwest Bangladesh. The practice of prawn and fish farming in rice fields is a form of integrated aquaculture-agriculture, which provides a wide range of social, economic and environmental benefits. Integrated prawn-fish-rice farming plays an important role in the economy of Bangladesh, earning foreign exchange and increasing food production. However, this unique farming system in coastal Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate change. We suggest that community-based adaptation strategies must be developed to cope with the challenges. We propose that integrated prawn-fish-rice farming could be relocated from the coastal region to less vulnerable inland areas, but caution that this will require appropriate adaptation strategies and an enabling institutional environment.

498,Suitable habitats of two coastal cetaceans along the northern Arabian Sea: Important marine mammal areas susceptible to conservation gaps,"Coastal cetaceans are often selected as a biodiversity surrogate in ecosystem-based conservation planning. In the northern Arabian Sea there is insufficient information on suitable habitats for the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise and Indian Ocean humpback dolphin for planning protection. Suitable habitats for the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise and Indian Ocean humpback dolphin were projected using the MaxEnt model in the present study. The variable contributions in MaxEnt exercises and characteristics of the major habitats were used to represent the ecological niches of these two cetaceans. Along coastal waters of the northern Arabian Sea, bathymetry was the most significant variable that influenced the distribution of the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, which prefers water 2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5Ã‚Â m deep. The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise prefers 6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20Ã‚Â m deep water and its distribution was influenced by bathymetry, sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration. Suitable habitats identified by this study provide a baseline from which to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities in coastal and estuarine waters, assist marine development planning and guide marine protected area (MPA) designations. Effective MPA designation would include ca. 30% of major habitats to accommodate viable populations and sufficient biodiversity richness to maintain a functioning ecosystem. Data used in the present study may be subject to sampling heterogeneity and thus coastal waters not included as suitable habitats would require further investigation for possible omission bias. Actions necessary for conservation of the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise and Indian Ocean humpback dolphin include designating no-take zones or MPAs, banning industrial fishing while restricting artisanal fishery activity and mobilizing community-based conservation campaigns for major habitat protection. As such, further data on distribution, density and environmental variables related to cetaceans are needed to inform any conservation efforts.

499,"Community-based participatory research projects and policy engagement to protect environmental health on St Lawrence Island, Alaska","Objectives. This article synthesizes discussion of collaborative research results, interventions and policy engagement for St Lawrence Island (SLI), Alaska, during the years 2000-2012. Methods. As part of on-going community-based participatory research (CBPR) studies on SLI, 5 discrete exposure-assessment projects were conducted: (a) a biomonitoring study of human blood serum; (b-d) 3 investigations of levels of contaminants in environmental media at an abandoned military site at Northeast Cape - using sediment cores and plants, semi-permeable membrane devices and blackfish, respectively; and (e) a study of traditional foods. Results. Blood serum in residents of SLI showed elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with higher levels among those exposed to the military site at Northeast Cape, an important traditional subsistence-use area. Environmental studies at the military site demonstrated that the site is a continuing source of PCBs to a major watershed, and that clean-up operations at the military site generated PCBcontaminated dust on plants in the region. Important traditional foods eaten by the people of SLI showed elevated concentrations of PCBs, which are primarily derived from the long-range transport of persistent pollutants that are transported by atmospheric and marine currents from more southerly latitudes to the north. Interventions. An important task for all CBPR projects is to conduct intervention strategies as needed in response to research results. Because of the findings of the CBPR projects on SLI, the CBPR team and the people of the Island are actively engaging in interventions to ensure cleanup of the formerly used military sites; reform chemicals policy on a national level; and eliminate persistent pollutants internationally. The goal is to make the Island and other northern/Arctic communities safe for themselves and future generations. Conclusions. As part of the CBPR projects conducted from 2000 to 2012, a series of exposure assessments demonstrate that the leaders of SLI have reason to be concerned about the health of people due to the presence of carcinogenic chemicals as measured in biomonitoring and environmental samples and important traditional foods.

500,Considerations for management of metapopulations in small-scale fisheries of the Mesoamerican barrier reef ecosystem,"From all of the fishing resources in the Caribbean region, a shared metapopulation of spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) has the highest market value, which together with its abundance and wide distribution, makes it the main source of income for a large number of coastal communities. Within this region, responsible use of shared marine areas, like the Mesoamerican barrier ecosystem, where multi-gear artisanal fisheries distributed in area of resource distribution play a significant role in affecting different components of the spiny lobster population structure and, in harvesting incidentally a high diversity of reef species, require approaches to manage multiple and competing uses of this marine area. The move towards EAF in the spiny lobster fishery of the Mesoamerican barrier ecosystem should be on an incremental and adaptive management basis in view of (i) much greater uncertainties when trying to include other species, habitats, and ecological interdependencies present in this ecosystem; (ii) the time needed to learn the principles of the EAF approach and acquire knowledge and information on the Mesoamerican barrier ecosystem. This involves more extensive coverage of capacity building in the countries involved for applying EAF; and (iii) the need to carefully assess the distributional implications of EAF interventions between coastal states and within them. For artisanal fisheries, EAF objectives and principles need to be revised and expanded to better reflect social, economic and institutional implications of management decisions. The need for considering data collection, advanced modelling and risk analysis for the use of sustainability indicators and reference points within the ecosystem approaches to fishery management, is also discussed. Understanding of EAF in the context of co-management and community-based management seems to be a priority. Ã‚Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

501,"Influence of latrine coverage and usage on diarrhoea incidence among children under 5 living in slum areas of Douala 5th sub-division, Cameroon","Introduction: lack of adequate sanitation facilities remain a major concern in developing countries. While around 41% of Cameroonians lack access to improved sanitation facilities, the 2011 National Survey revealed a diarrhoea incidence rate of 21% in children under five years, two weeks before interview. This study aimed at evaluating the influence of latrine coverage and usage on diarrhoeic disease outcome among children under 5. Methods: a cross-sectional study was carried out in March 2016 in pre-selected slums areas of Douala 5th district. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from one consenting adult per household. Data analysis was carried out using Epi Info version 7.1.4.0. PearsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chi square and Fisher exact test were used to estimate the influence of latrine coverage on the incidence of diarrhoea. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: of the 384 households enrolled, 69.01% had latrine facilities, while 30.99% shared latrines with neighbouring households. Sixty point sixteen percent (60.16%) (231/384) of all households used pit latrines. Although consistent use of latrines by all adults was reported, 20.05% of children under 5 practiced open-air defecation. The incidence of diarrhoea among children under 5 years 2 weeks before interview was 29.25%, of which 26.35% were bloody stools. Diarrhoea outcome was significantly associated with use of pit latrines (p &lt; 0.01); lack of cover on latrines hole (p &lt; 0.0001) and proximity of latrines to household (p=0.01). Conclusion: poor faecal waste management and lack of improved sanitation facilities contribute significantly to diarrhoeal episodes among children under 5. A structured strategy to improve community-based sanitation considering urban planning and sanitation campaigns would promote safer environment and reduce outcome of water-borne and diarrhoeic diseases.

502,OstromÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Governance Principles and Sustainable Financing of Fish Reserves,"Previous studies on community-based natural resource management have repeatedly underlined the significance of the design principles for sustainable commons governance developed by Elinor Ostrom. In this paper, we apply the principles heuristically to the case of the Sikunga Channel Fish Protection Area (FPA), a recently established fish reserve in the Upper Zambezi in Namibia. Based on qualitative fieldwork including semi-structured household interviews, expert interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation, we assess the utility of OstromÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s design principles as guidance for promoting sustainable fisheries co-management structures. Our results indicate that the lack of a sustainable financing mechanism is both a major source of resentments at Sikunga and the main obstacle for sound resource management, endangering the long-term effectiveness and social acceptance of the fish reserve.

In-depth interviews by using semi structured questionnaire 102 fishers households and participatory rural appraisal towards 7 communities along the Pak Phanang River were used to collect the data from January to May, 2011.

The fishers were highly appreciative the good cooperation of the authorities for fisheries management. Similarly, they agreed onsome conservation measures, particularly fishing prohibited regulation during the spawning season in spawning grounds and illegal gears ban but disagreed with controlling the quantity of fish caught, ruling on the number of fishers and fishing period setting. Moreover, the fishers mainly requested taking more participating role in fisheries reconstructing predominantly in decision making of the planning process.

504,Shifts in the distribution and abundance of coastal marine species along the eastern Pacific Ocean during marine heatwaves from 2013 to 2018,"Background: Ongoing global ocean warming and a recent increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves have demonstrably impacted marine ecosystems. Growing evidence points to both short-and longterm biological changes, across several levels of organization. While range shifts are among the predicted responses, few studies are focused solely on documenting such changes. Here we report ecological changes in response to marine heatwaves across multiple taxa in the eastern Pacific from central California to Baja California. Methods: Sea surface temperature data from two estuaries and one coastal site were analyzed to define the number, duration, and intensity of marine heatwaves occurring in central and southern California from 2013 to 2018. Long-term monitoring programs and short-term research projects in coastal and estuarine ecosystems serendipitously collected specimens or photographs of extralimital species from central California to the Baja California Peninsula. Spatial and temporal sampling protocols and the targeted species for six unrelated programs varied greatly, from annual to monthly at both fixed and variable locations. In addition, anomalous occurrences were reported to staff at local and regional marine and estuarine protected areas and noted in local news and social media outlets. Anomalous range detections were categorized as range expansions and extensions, reappearances, abundance increases, shifts into new habitats, and range contractions. Results: Multiple marine heatwaves occurred from 2014 to 2018, peaking in 2015. Marine heatwaves were more intense and longer in the estuaries, with a maximum duration of 109 days in 2015. We observed 29 species that had responded to the warm water anomalies of 2014-2018 along the eastern Pacific Ocean between central California and the Baja California Peninsula: 7 expansions, 2 extensions, 10 reappearances, 7 increases, 2 shifts into new habitats, and 1 apparent contraction. These shifts included algae, invertebrates and fishes. Twenty species were observed by professional biologists involved both in long-term monitoring programs and short-term studies, 6 by amateur naturalists as part of community-based science programs in the field, and 3 through a combination of all three Conclusions: Increased warm waters, sustained for an unprecedented 4 of 5 years, facilitated the northward redistribution of multiple species from several taxonomic groups. Species shifting northward were from warmtemperate and subtropical ecosystems to the south. In the absence of programs designed to detect range shifts, we must rely on the serendipitous observations of biologists conducting both long-term monitoring and short-term research, and the growing wealth of information from community-based science programs made available via online databases.

505,Catalyzing sustainable fisheries management through behavior change interventions,"Small-scale fisheries are an important livelihood and primary protein source for coastal communities in many of the poorest regions in the world, yet many are overfished and thus require effective and scalable management solutions. Positive ecological and socioeconomic responses to management typically lag behind immediate costs borne by fishers from fishing pressure reductions necessary for fisheries recovery. These short-term costs challenge the long-term success of these interventions. However, social marketing may increase perceptions of management benefits before ecological and socioeconomic benefits are fully realized, driving new social norms and ultimately long-term sustainable behavior change. By conducting underwater visual surveys to quantify ecological conditions and by conducting household surveys with community members to quantify their perceptions of management support and socioeconomic conditions, we assessed the impact of a standardized small-scale fisheries management intervention that was implemented across 41 sites in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The intervention combines TURF reserves (community-based territorial use rights for fishing coupled with no-take marine reserves) with locally tailored social-marketing behavior change campaigns. Leveraging data across 22 indicators and 4 survey types, along with data from 3 control sites, we found that ecological and socioeconomic impacts varied and that communities supported the intervention and were already changing their fishing practices. These results suggest that communities were developing new social norms and fishing more sustainably before long-term ecological and socioeconomic benefits of fisheries management materialized.

506,"Adapting to declining fish resources: The differentiation of livelihood systems and fishing strategies in Singkarak Lake's fishing community, West Sumatra","In Southeast Asia, inland fish resources are crucial for small-scale fishing households. Their decline, due to overfishing and a set of socio-ecological factors, jeopardises aquatic ecosystems and the livelihoods of fishing communities. Singkarak Lake (West Sumatra) exemplifies this sustainability challenge. The paper proposes a multi-disciplinary analysis of the situation. First, it identifies and documents the primary livelihood systems and the strategic adaptations involved in fishing communities. Based upon a sample of 200 households and the implementation of multivariate analyses, a typology is developed. Three household types are identified. Type I comprises better-off farming fishers that have high fishing capitals and income but the lowest returns on fishing and land assets. Type II includes poor fishing farmers with higher farming income; they show the highest return on land assets. Type III is composed of poorer, younger fishers with the highest return on fishing assets and fishing costs. They have little land, low farming income, and diversified livelihood sources. Second, the technical efficiency (TE) of fishing households is studied using a data envelopment analysis. The results show that the average TE is low, but marked differences exist between the types. Type I households have the lowest TE in fishing, confirming an extensification and overcapitalisation strategy. Type II households show a high technical fishing efficiency. They have developed on-farm diversification with a combined, balanced livelihood system. Type III households are the most efficient fishers. They developed an intensification strategy together with off-farm diversification. Different livelihood strategies and economic portfolio have been developed as the response to the limited resources, uncertainty, fluctuating environment and other source of vulnerability. The fishers built up their livelihood based on their assets' ownership, access to other resource out of fishing and their socio-economic status. In this context, understanding livelihood diversity among small-scale fishers, different socio-economic, their efficiency, constraints and opportunities emerge as important factor in policy formulation to enhance support to small-scale fishing communities and improved management of both the resources and local development. Finally, the paper suggests a focus on people and community-related solutions and proposes a threefold approach of resource conservation, livelihood improvements and restructured governance.

507,Establishment of a fish sanctuary for conserving indigenous fishes in the largest freshwater swamp forest of Bangladesh: A community-based management approach,"Fish sanctuary is considered as an important structural management tool for restoring fish biodiversity and enhancing fisheries production. Therefore, this study was conducted in the Ratargul Swamp Forest (RSF) of Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a fish sanctuary on native fish biodiversity in and around the forest ecosystem. The investigation was carried out through focus group discussions, personal interviews, and direct catch assessments during fishing operations by the local fishers. After two years of study, 65 species of indigenous fishes were recorded for 46 genera under 23 families covering 9 orders, where Cypriniformes and Cypriniidae are the dominant order and family, respectively. After the establishment of the fish sanctuary, there was an increasing tendency of fish population was observed in the RSF and the adjacent Shari-Goyain and Kapna Rivers. In the RSF, fish diversity indices such as Simpson dominance index (D), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), Margalef richness index (d), and Pielou evenness index (J) varied from 0.12-0.09, 2.77Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.98, 6.15Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6.14, and 0.66Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.71, respectively indicating species diversity enrichment in the final year compared to baseline assessment year which is supposed to be associated with the impact of fish sanctuary establishment.

508,Seasonal variation of Opisthorchis viverrini infection in cyprinoid fish in north-east Thailand: Implications for parasite control and food safety,"Reported is the seasonal pattern of Opisthorchis viverrini metacercariae in cyprinoid fish in north-east Thailand. Samples of fish were collected in 1991-92 at monthly intervals from two areas - Khon Kaen Province, where the opisthorchiasis transmission rate was high, and Mahasarakham Province, where the rate was low. Metacercarial loads in both study areas had similar seasonal patterns. High burdens occurred in the late rainy season and winter (July to January) with low burdens during the summer (March to June). The average burden for Puntius leiacanthus in Khon Kaen was 1.68 metacercariae per fish (127.43 per kg), higher than for all species of cyprinoid fish from the low transmission area. The intensities of infection among P. leiacanthus and Cyclocheilichthys armatus collected in Mahasarakham were comparable, but lower than the intensity of Hampala dispar (0.75 metacercariae per fish) concurrently sampled from the same area (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in metacercarial load per kg between fish species from Mahasarakham. The results indicate that seasonal variation in metacercariae was a common phenomenon in areas with both high and low endemicity of infection. Also, the metacercarial load in fish was positively associated with infection levels among humans.Food-borne trematode infections such as Opisthorchis viverrini are a major cause of morbidity in Asia. Samples of cyprinoid fish collected at monthly intervals during 1991-92 in two provinces (Khon Kaen and Mahasarakham) in North East Thailand revealed substantial seasonal variation of O viverrini metacercariae. The former province is a low transmission area (29.7% average infection rate), while the latter is a high transmission area. Metacercarial intensity was highest from January-March 1991 and October 1991-April 1992, with maximum intensities during February and December 1991. Puntius leiacanthus fish from Khon Kaen bore the highest density of metacercariae per individual fish (1.68). Differences in the intensity of infection for the same species of fish captured in two different geographic areas presumably reflect variations in environmental conditions such as local levels of human and snail infections. Fecal contamination of the study reservoirs is greatest during the early parts of the rainy season as a result of run-off drainage and coincides with the rapid increase in snail populations. The optimal time for large-scale community-based parasite control programs is when the probability of rapid reinfection is lowest and the prevalence and intensity of infection in people are highest (e.g., April-June or the summer months). Most effective is a program that integrates parasite control, environmental management, health education, and food safety.",NA,No,"The study is based in Thailand, which is not one of the countries specified in the Screening Criteria."," No; The study is clearly stated to be conducted in Thailand, not in any of the listed countries.

509,Linking population to conservation. Special report: Pakistan.,"The National Conservation Strategy of Pakistan took 5 years to prepare and it was produced in close consultation with the World Conservation Union (IUCN), on whose World Conservation Strategy it is modeled. The environment has been under grave stress for the past 30 years, the ecosystem has been greatly damaged, and natural resources are being depleted at an alarming rate. Deforestation is occurring at a rate of 1'%/year in a country where forest cover is down to 5%. Desertification has affected 60% of Pakistan's land. Soil erosion threatens over 11 million hectares and waterlogging and salinity 1/2 as much. Many species of plants, animals, and fish face extinction, as river and mangrove systems are almost destroyed. Over 25% of hospital patients are ill from waterborne diseases, and 60% of infant deaths are caused by infectious and parasitic diseases. The neglect of women's development is responsible for the average family size of 6.7 children. The population is projected to double in 22 years, from 100 million to 200 million, and at the present rate it could reach 400 million by the year 2033. Although the crude death rate has dropped from over 25/1000 in 1984-86, and the infant mortality rate has fallen from 180/1000 to 106, the birth rate has hardly changed, falling only from 45 to 43/1000. In the 40 years since independence government family planning efforts have been feeble without success in reducing birth rates. Water resources are also scarce: only a 25-30% expansion in the volume of water is available in the Indus Basin. Biological solutions, farm forestry, increased water efficiency, demand-based irrigation, less wasteful and more decentralized use of energy are recommended rather than cost-intensive use of the soil.

511,A sea change on the African coast? Preliminary social and ecological outcomes of a governance transformation in Kenyan fisheries,"We examined social and ecological outcomes over a period of transformational change in the governance of Kenyan fisheries. Devolving decision-making power to local communities initially promoted a perception of winners and losers among resource users, but after just 6 years, there were virtually no resource users who felt that the new governance arrangement was detrimental to their livelihood. The current lack of negative perceptions toward co-management provides a critical window of opportunity to strengthen local governance institutions by investing in leadership capacity, transparency, and enforcement. This newly acquired authority to capture the benefits from local management resulted in an unexpected proliferation of community-based marine reserves - a substantial change to the anti-reserve discourse that halted the government's most recent attempt to establish a national marine reserve. Several community-based reserves showed increases in fish biomass and coral cover, while others did not and likely suffered from poor compliance and weak management. Despite some seemingly positive early social and ecological outcomes, co-management should not be viewed as a panacea to Kenya's fisheries challenges, but rather as one of many tools for improving the chances of achieving social-ecological sustainability.

This study examines the socioeconomic impacts of a community-led reforestation project in the Philippines through a survey of the local fishers. Revenues from mangrove fisheries, tourism and timber result in an annual benefit to the community of US$ 315 ha-1 yr-1. This figure is likely to be considerably more if the contribution of the mangrove to the coastal catch of mangrove-associated species is included. This estimate only includes direct benefits to the community from mangroves, and not intangible benefits such as coastal protection, which paradoxically is perceived by the community as one of the most important functions. More than 90% of all fishers, regardless of where they fished, thought the mangrove provided protection from storms and typhoons and acted as a nursery site and should be protected. Those fishing only in the mangrove perceived more benefits from the mangrove and were prepared to pay more to protect it than those fishing outside. This study concludes that replanting mangroves can have a significant economic impact on the lives of coastal communities. Acknowledgement of the value of replanted mangroves compared with other coastal activities and the benefits they bring to the more economically-vulnerable coastal dwellers should support better informed policy and decision-making with regard to coastal habitat restoration.

513,Using community members to assess artisanal fisheries: The marine turtle fishery in Madagascar,"Fisheries are considered a major driver of population declines for many marine vertebrate species, and yet for some, data on the levels of direct catch are lacking, often due to the logistical challenges in assessing artisanal fisheries in remote and developing regionsUsing community members to collect data can provide access to a greater wealth of information than that obtained by local or foreign researchers, often at a reduced financial costWe monitored the harvest of marine turtles at 12 major villages in Madagascar using community members as data collectors (sous collecteurs) from each village, at a total cost of <US$3000 for 1 yearCommunity members were trained to collect biological and fisheries data on turtles landed and to use digital cameras to provide a visual record of each turtle catch recordedA total of 699 marine turtle landings were documented, including four species, with by far the majority being green turtles Chelonia mydas (93.6%)When we contextualize our data with those of previous studies elsewhere in the region, we conservatively estimate that the annual turtle catch in the south-western province of Madagascar is between 10000 and 16000Although turtle hunting is illegal under national law, there are currently no government initiatives to manage the fisheryThis study is the first direct assessment of the level of exploitation of turtles in Madagascar, made possible through the use of community members as data collectors and has broad applicability towards similar data-gathering efforts in other artisanal fisheries.

Men do most of the fishing, but women collect aquatic plants and snails. A women-only, a men-only, and a mixed community based organisation (CBO) are compared, each of which manages a seasonal wetland. The CBOs involving women are in Hindu communities where more women use aquatic resources and belong to other local institutions. In the oldest of these CBOs, women have gradually increased their role as community recognition of their success has grown. In the Muslim community few women collect aquatic resources, and they have no role in the CBO. Community compliance was higher where both men and women played an active role in the process.

515,"Procedural and distributive justice in a community-based managed Marine Protected Area in Zanzibar, Tanzania","Local participation in governance and management is assumed to lead to something good. But it is rarely explicitly stated who are participating and in what. The study investigates this in the context of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Zanzibar, Tanzania, and in particular the Memba Island - Chwaka Bay Marine Conservation Area (MIMCA). This is done by applying Pretty's typology of participation in addressing procedural justice, which is according to Paavola linked to distributive justice, i.e. the just distribution of costs and benefits. How does participation in MIMCA facilitate procedural and distributive justice? To answer this question a number of fishermen, women seaweed farmers, local leaders, and representatives of the private sector were interviewed (n=136) in five villages. Interviews were also made with government officials at relevant departments. The results show that Village Fishermen Committees were participating in the implementation of MIMCA but not in its planning phase. Participation was mainly in the form of manipulative and passive participation. Other local actors did not participate at all. Instead, the government assumed that justice was achieved by distributing equipment, alternative income generating projects, and relying on tourism for local development. However, the distributed equipment and tourism development have created conflict and injustice within and between villages, because of the insufficient resources which did not target those in need. Tourism created problems such as inequality between livelihoods, environmental destruction and local power asymmetries between hotel management and local people. The MIMCA top-down intervention has not increased participation or justice, nor has it achieved sustainable resource use and conflict resolution. It is suggested that interactive participation by all local actors is needed to create just trade-offs. Justice needs to be explicitly addressed for integrated conservation and development projects to achieve sustainability.

516,"A multiple evidence-based approach to MÃƒÂ©tis community-based monitoring: a case study from the South Athabasca Oil Sands Area, Alberta, Canada","This original research article provides a case study that describes how MÃƒÂ©tis indigenous knowledge was incorporated into the design of a community-based monitoring (CBM) program in the South Athabasca Oil Sands Area of Alberta, Canada. Athabasca Landing MÃƒÂ©tis Community (ALMC) members have traditional knowledge of local wildlife and climatic conditions in a region that has seen intense oil and gas-related industrial activity over the last 50 years. Informed by a multiple evidence-based approach to CBM, ALMCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s program design combined traditional hunting, fishing, trapping, and plant gathering activities with photomapping methods. By taking geo-referenced photos of their environmental observations, which they shared with other project participants during regular monitoring meetings, MÃƒÂ©tis knowledge holders connected changes in local conditions such as resource scarcity or species abundance to broader ecological processes including climate change. Further, the monitoring program had an innovative cultural camp component that brought elders, heads of family, and youth together to deliberately interact and pass on Indigenous and local knowledge. The information drawn from photomapping, cultural camps, and traditional knowledge shared during meetings was gathered into a database. The database serves as a repository of traditional knowledge and land use data that will support ALMCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ongoing efforts to identify territory to promote self-governance and assert rights to lands and resources. We discuss how the ALMCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adoption of a multiple evidence-based approach to monitoring asserts control over data collection methods, storage, and dissemination, supports local capacity for self-determination, and amplifies the voices of MÃƒÂ©tis harvesters in the resource management sector.

517,Taking care of people and communities: Rebuilding livelihoods through NGOs and the informal economy in Southern Thailand,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of NGOs in facilitating economic recovery to the tsunami devastated regions in Southern Thailand. This includes large international NGOs as well as small community based or local NGOs and how these organizations engage with one another as well as with government authorities and of course the local community to aid recovery. In particular, focus will be on how NGOs are able to assist local residents, especially those engaged in the informal sector in rebuilding their livelihoods in a region that has been devastated by a natural disaster. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken in the paper has concentrated on analysing the response of various NGOs as well as industry representatives and government authorities in considering how response efforts and recovery initiatives have impacted, and will continue to impact on the lives and livelihoods of those living in affected communities as rebuilding takes place. Findings - Given that in Thailand just over 70 per cent of the population is employed in the informal sector of the economy one of the key findings of this paper is that central to economic recovery is the need for policy makers directing recovery strategies to reflect measures that are broadly supportive of the informal sector across different industries including tourism and fisheries, and which provides the basis of economic livelihood for a large proportion of the affected Thai population. Originality/value - The paper shows that recovery strategies must engage with and directly involve the community to ensure long-term economic recovery that is able to both build local resilience and provide the basis of livelihood support for the future sustainability of the local population.

518,Inuit food security in canada: arctic marine ethnoecology,"Quantitative Seascape Ethnoecology practice is considered through a community-based food security lens. Fish and marine mammal records obtained from a wide range of Inuit co-management agreements are, for the first time combined to calculate an Inuit-culture marine ecological footprint, targeted on calendar year 2008. A reflexive, participatory and inclusive education/governance strategy for Arctic coastal food security is presented, particularly in Nunavut; considering caloric marine catch may average as high as 40% of human basal metabolic requirements for some communities. The current work provides a foundation to mitigate food insecurity for the Inuit in what may be the most insecure indigenous food setting in any country that is generally considered as developed. Four large marine ecosystems are considered within Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) areas 18 and 21. Initial fish catch reconstructions for 1950Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001 are combined with mammal harvest records. Food system changes and planning are examined from a community health and management perspective. The relationship between food security, gender, livelihoods and ecosystem capacity are discussed within current management challenges and the related mandates for Canadian government agencies, based in part upon the 2007, United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). A process to combine academic ecological knowledge with traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and an Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) is suggested within a beneficiary-led marine protected area network. A re-evaluation of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s northern (Nunavut) transfer and land claim agreements are suggested, with a goal to provide redress for UNDRIP compliance.

519,Evaluation criteria for participatory research: Insights from coastal Uruguay,"Participatory research in which experts and non-experts are co-researchers in addressing local concerns (also known as participatory action research or community-based research) can be a valuable approach for dealing with the uncertainty of social-ecological systems because it fosters learning among stakeholders and co-production of knowledge. Despite its increased application in the context of natural resources and environmental management, evaluation of participatory research has received little attention. The objectives of this research were to define criteria to evaluate participatory research processes and outcomes, from the literature on participation evaluation, and to apply them in a case study in an artisanal fishery in coastal Uruguay. Process evaluation criteria (e.g., problem to be addressed of key interest to local and additional stakeholders; involvement of interested stakeholder groups in every research stage; collective decision making through deliberation; and adaptability through iterative cycles) should be considered as conditions to promote empowering participatory research. Our research contributes to knowledge on evaluation of participatory research, while also providing evidence of the positive outcomes of this approach, such as co-production of knowledge, learning, strengthened social networks, and conflict resolution.

520,"MOdeling, visualizing, and mining hydrologic spatial hierarchies for water quality management","Water quality managers analyze data collected in the field to assess environmental conditions and enact policy based on water quality impairments identified in this analysis. Water quality is often based on measures of water chemistry and the health of biological communities. There are many factors spread across the landscape that contribute to water quality. This adds a spatial dimension to the problem. Furthermore, data are often analyzed based on aggregations of site level data to multiple hierarchies of watersheds. This paper presents a multidimensional data model which incorporates hydrological spatial hierarchies for the purpose of analyzing water quality data at multiple resolutions. The data model was implemented in a relational database management system and linked with a geographic information system to provide visual exploration of data across multiple levels within the spatial hierarchy. Data mining techniques such as classification and association rule generation were applied to data at multiple levels of the hydrologic spatial hierarchy. Classification was applied to predict the health of fish communities based on site habitat characteristics and measures of water chemistry. Association rules were developed to determine relationships between site characteristic and water quality variables and fish community health. The results of the classification and association rules were then compared across two levels of the hydrographic spatial hierarchy.",NA,No,The paper does not specify a case study from any of the listed countries in the title or abstract.," No; The abstract does not mention any specific location or case study from the listed countries.

521,Overall subarachnoid hemorrhage outcomes in Miyagi Prefecture: A comparative analysis for the years 1984 and 1991,"The annual per population incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in Miyagi Prefecture has been calculated as being 17.0/100,000 recently. In order to determine whether changes have occurred in the overall SAH outcomes over recent years, we have analyzed the annual 1984 and 1991 SAH outcomes contained in a community-based stroke register in Miyagi Prefecture. From a total of 302 SAH cases for 1984 and 351 SAH cases for 1991, the complete clinical records of 268 cases and 321 cases, respectively, were extracted for this analysis. The male-to-female SAH patient ratio has shifted from 1:8 to 2:3 between the two studied years, and the average age has increased from 50.8 years to 53.4 years for males and from 58.2 years to 60.5 years for females. Further, the average pre hospitalization period from SAH onset has shortened from 4.6 days to 2.4 days. The number of SAH cases with a poor grading, i.e., Grades 4 and 5 of Hunt and Kosnik grading, has increased from 19. 8% to 27.1% and the number of Fisher's group 3 patients has similarly increased from 43.2% to 61.3%. In general, acute stage SAH patients under 75 years of age with Hunt and Kosnik grading of less than Grade 4 underwent surgery in both years. In this regard, the number of SAH cases operated on within 3 days increased from 59.9% to 72.1%. As a result of earlier hospitalization and an increase in acute-stage operations, there was a decrease in presurgical aneurysmal reruptures from 36.6% to 29.1%, as well as a decrease in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasms, especially in Fisher's group 2 and 3 cases. On the contrary, no significant improvement in the surgical result was found between the two years (excellent 52.8%; good 23.8%; fair 14.5%; poor 4.2%; and dead 4.7% for the 212 cases in 1984 versus excellent 54.4%; good 18.3%; fair 11.1%; poor 5.6%; and dead 10.7% for 254 cases in 1991). Similarly, SAH cases given conservative treatment schowed poor outcomes in both years. This comparative analysis could not reveal any overall improvement in the SAH outcomes.

522,Do market and trust contexts spillover into public goods contributions? Evidence from experimental games in Papua New Guinea,"The provision of public goods, such as voluntary enforcement efforts, can be critical to the management of natural resources. However, the degree to which context can influence people's contributions to the public good is poorly understood. Here, we used sequential games in a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlab in the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experimental setting with a fishing community in Papua New Guinea to explore whether behavior in two particular contextsÃ¢â‚¬â€market and trustÃ¢â‚¬â€spill over public goods' contributions. Behavioral spillovers occur when behavior in one context influencesÃ¢â‚¬â€or is transferred toÃ¢â‚¬â€behavior in another context. Our results indicate that there is spillover, but surprisingly this occurs from specific roles assumed within the context rather than the broader context itself. The existence of behavioral spillovers into public goods can render conservation initiatives that rely on contributions ineffective, or even damaging if they crowd out intrinsic behavior. Understanding the potential biases different contextÃ¢â‚¬â€e.g. markets created by market-based instruments or trust relied upon by community-based mechanismÃ¢â‚¬â€can create, is necessary for the implementation of effective and efficient conservation initiatives.

523,Social and economic implications of small-scale mud crab (Scylla serrata) aquaculture: The case of organised community groups,"Small-scale mud crab aquaculture was introduced in East Africa in late 1990s as a mangrove friendly aquaculture to improve the livelihood of coastal communities through organised community groups (OCGs). The OCGs approach was a strategy aimed at ensuring benefits to the village and regulating access to the open access resource (land in mangrove forests). A social and economic assessment was conducted at Majaoni, Makongeni, Ihaleni and Dabaso along the Kenyan coast. The paper looks at the social and economic characteristics of the groups, their management systems, contribution of mud crab aquaculture to the livelihoods of local communities and policy issues related to the interventions. There is wider involvement of the mijikenda community in mud crab farming; however, the level of women participation is low. A strong market link exists between the groups and the different market outlets, where hotels and exporters offer the highest prices. Regional price variations existed and may need networking between the groups. The paper concludes that national policies may need to be redirected to support small-scale aquaculture development and ensuring capacity building for women, operation and management of groups, provision of extension services, data management and provision of user rights for communities working in the mangrove environment.

525,Community-based dopi beel wetland management,"Bangladesh is one of the deltaic region countries in south-east Asia. It consists of extreme floodplains, rivers, low and plain land. The siltation or sediment plays an important role in increasing the floodplain, rivers and low-lying areas. Community people face a lot of problems with silted up the beels and other wetlands. Due to this, the aquatic habitats of floodplain areas are decreasing day by day. Proshika is one of the largest national NGOs of Bangladesh and has implemented the Community-based Fisheries Management phase-2 (CBFM-2) project in collaboration with World Fish Center, Department of Fisheries (DoF) funded by the Department for International Development (DFID). The Dopi beel is one of the floodplain beels under CBFM-2 project. The beel is situated 150 km east-north from the capital of Dhaka under Mithamon Upazilla in the Kishoregonj district. The total area of the beel is 15.51 ha. All the beels areas are filling up except 1.50 ha due to sediments that come from upstream with flowing current water in the rainy season. In the dry season all the beels area are dried-up and during the monsoon period the water-depth is approximate 12-15 ft and it is connected with two rivers. There are seven villages situated in the surrounding periphery of the beels. There were two Beel Management Committees (BMCs) formed by Proshika for sustainable management of the wetland. The BMC consists of 34 representatives from seven villages. On the basis of BMC decisions all the related project partners agreed to the removal of the sediment or siltation from the beels. The community people started to remove sediment from the low-lying area of the beels and it will be completed next year. It has been suggested that after completion of sediment removal, the community people will plant aquatic plants in the embankment. Last year they also released common carp fingerlings in the beel and harvested 30% of the fish from the wetland.

528,The Silos of Natural Resource Governance: Implications of Sector-led Coastal Management at the Village Level in Kenya and Zanzibar-Tanzania,"Taking a coordinated, holistic approach to the governance of coastal ecosystems is widely advocated in recognition of the need to manage ecosystems as a whole. Despite commitment to approaches such as integrated coastal zone management and ecosystem-based management of fisheries, governance remains fragmented, with sectors such as environment, fisheries and forestry maintaining separate systems of governance from the national to village level. These systems include the formation of separate community-based structures, reporting directly to the respective sectoral ministry. This raises questions about how this collaborative governance approach aligns with taking a more integrated, holistic approach to management. The paper draws on findings from research in Kenya and Zanzibar-Tanzania in coastal villages where forest and fisheries management groups have been formed. The research found that the groups operate in compartmentalised 'silos', in contrast to the interrelated ecosystems on which they depend, with little coordination of plans and priorities. In addition, these groups are not consistent in their relationship to local government, answering directly to the sectoral ministry rather than democratic local government, raising issues for accountability and sustainability. These dual challenges of a sectoral-focus and long-term sustainability must be addressed for management of ecosystems to be integrated and effective.

529,The inclusion of fisheries and tourism in marine protected areas to support conservation in Indonesia,"With the rapid growth of Indonesia's marine protected area (MPAs) estate in Indonesia, reaching 23.9 million hectares by January 2020, attention needs to be focused on strengthening the effectiveness of MPA management. Consolidating and expanding protection of Indonesia's marine resources is critical with increasing pressure from a fast-expanding population, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, pollution, coastal development, unsustainable tourism and climate change. Biodiversity conservation must therefore concurrently consider multiple economic sectors such as fisheries and tourism, and their synergies with MPA management. This paper aims to outline the current landscape of fisheries and marine tourism pertaining to area-based conservation in Indonesia, to inform and support improved integration into effective MPA management. Four areas to focus efforts were identified: diversification of governance types of community-based management, improved coordination between fisheries and MPAs during planning and management implementation, the development and support of pathways for sustainable tourism, and planning for future conditions. Sustainable development for fisheries and tourism must be incorporated into all aspects of MPA management, whilst recognising that current management systems are insufficient to ensure long-term sustainability for natural resources and local communities, and strategies need to increase resilience of social-ecological systems in anticipation of future conditions.

530,"The Community-based Management of Coastal Fisheries in Himeshima, Oita Prefecture, Japan: A Case Study of the Fishing Ground Regulations on the Offshore Fixed Gill Net Fishery","In recent arguments about fisheries management, the community-based approach has attracted more attention. The aim of this paper is to investigate the content and meanings of the fisheries management carried out by a coastal community with various fisheries, and moreover to examine the dynamic aspects of the management, considering changes in the environment and changes in its use. The study area is Himeshima, Oita Prefecture, an island whose economy has been highly dependent on small-scale coastal fisheries. The fishermen there have constituted the 'Gyogyo-kisetsu', a written code of fishing activities, under a fisheries cooperative association. The case studied in this paper is the fishing ground regulations, that is to say, the spatial restrictions of fishing ground use on the offshore fixed gill net fishery in the Gyogyo-kisetsu. The fishery became popular in the late 1960s and detailed fishing ground regulations have been applied to it as the fixed nets occupy the sea widely. Examination of the contents of these regulations reveals that they have been constituted and carried out mainly for adjustment between the gill net fishery and other fisheries. The operations of 'weaker' fisheries or conventional fisheries, such as the angling fishery, the longline fishery and the surrounding seine fishery, on important fishing grounds, have been protected by the adjustment. In introducing the modern gill net fishery, it was crucial for the community to develop regulations to. enable the coexistence of old and new fisheries and to avoid conflicts. In addition, such adjustment has been sometimes related to the conservation of fishery resources and important fishing grounds. On the other hand, the environment and the use of the fishing grounds where the gill net fishery is regulated have not remained static but have sometimes undergone big changes up to the present day. Distinct examples are the sharp decrease in sand lance and the decline of some conventional fisheries, influencing the state of fishing ground use. Despite these changes, each fishing ground regulation on the gill net fishery has been kept in the Gyogyo-kisetsu up to the present day since it was established, even though its actual function or meanings can be somewhat flexible and variable. These facts show that the regulations have been maintained and carried out in an imbalanced relationship with the fishing ground environment or the fishing ground use affected by fluctuations. Examination of such dynamic aspects of the regulations indicates some vagueness or ambiguity inherent in the management carried out in the relationship with an uncertain environment.

531,Fishing for consensus: Community-based conservation and conflict in St LuciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SoufriÃƒÂ¨re marine management area,"This chapter recounts the politically volatile implementation process of the first two years of a new marine management area in the Caribbean island of St Lucia. The Soufriere Marine Management Area (SMMA) is an internationally acclaimed model of community-based resource management, established in response to concerns that environmental degradation and conflicts among resource users were threatening the local tourism industry and the livelihoods of fishermen. Conflicts between tourists and local fishermen were a critical motivating force behind the establishment of the SMMA. Conflicts also occurred between fishermen and scuba divers. The SMMA is a multiple-use marine protected area that resembles the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park model, although on a much smaller scale. There are five types of use zones: marine reserves, fishing priority areas, multiple use areas, recreational areas, and yacht mooring areas. The SMMA's initial failure to fulfill the high expectations of its architects was due only in part to the shortcomings identified in the institutional review. Ã‚Â© Jonathan Pugh and Robert B.

532,Managing redundancy in overexploited fisheries,"This paper reviews and catalogs current approaches for facilitating the exit of redundant capital and labor from overexploited fisheries. It begins with an examination of fishery management objectives and the different measures used to achieve these objectives. It then discusses, in the context of the challenges confronting fishery management, the problems surrounding the exit of capital and labor from overexploited fisheries. The paper examines approaches that can be used to facilitate exit from both industrial and artisanal fisheries, citing several relevant case studies as well as the experience of different countries. The continuing dual existence of industrial and artisanal fisheries in developing countries poses special challenges to fishery management, which needs to recognize and treat each type of fishery differently. For artisanal fisheries, economic diversification and community-based nonfishery solutions need to be pursued and made an integral part of any comprehensive adjustment package. -from Author",NA,No,The abstract does not provide information about a case study from the specified countries.," No; The abstract does not mention any specific case study from the listed countries.

533,"Participatory mapping: Assessing problems and defined marine conservation planning and zoning in jor bay, indonesia","Jor Bay Lombok is a marine protected area (MPA) which is initiated by local communities, which have a local-driven marine management regulation called Awiq-Awiq. Unfortunately, the fisheries condition has continued to decline in the past decades, where the rate of exploitation of capture fisheries in Jor Bay shows an unbalanced condition because the harvest value is still higher than the recruitments and growth. Awiq-Awiq regulates all existing utilization and protection of marine resources, but yet, has not included spatial aspects, leaving a situation that leads to unsustainability for fisheries resources and other resources. Balanced zoning of ecosystems and marine resources is needed in order to ensure the sustainability of the fisheries system in Jor Bay. This paper aims to illustrate how a marine spatial planning approach in a local MPA can be built with a community-based zoning system. The integration of local systems and formal-government systems is very effective and fast in the development of MPA zoning systems by considering the optimum allocation of the existence of ecosystems that guarantee the natural metabolic processes of the fisheries system in the Bay. The implementation of the MPA zoning system is expected to be able to support the guarantee of sustainable fisheries production for the surrounding region.

It includes ten chapters that focus on the following five aspects: 1) An overview of distributed generation is introduced in Chapter One, and the technical concept of the microgrid is introduced in Chapter Eight with detail. 2) As the main element of distributed generation (DG), a smart inverter system for the control of active and reactive power in a grid-tied mode, which is treated as an interface between grid and the RES (Renewable Energy System), is studied concretely in Chapter Two. 3) The influence of distributed generation on power systems, including the impact of DG on the planning and operation of power systems, the impact of DG on power quality, and power system protection are concretely described and analyzed in Chapters Three, Four and Five, respectively. 4) The control and optimization technologies for DG and MG. These techniques include: the Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) strategy for the solution of pricing management in community-based microgrids (MGs), which consider economic benefits as the control and optimization objects; the distributed control and optimization techniques for islanded microgrids (MGs) that consider stability as the control and optimization objects; the intelligent load shedding for stability enhancement in an autonomous microgrid; and the recovery (restoration) control after a contingency situation. These are all investigated in Chapters Six, Seven, Eight and Nine, respectively. 5) The applications of renewable energy technology, such as efficient artisanal light fishing technologies that exploit lake light physics and light-fish interactions, are specifically presented in Chapter Ten.

536,"The last generation? Perspectives of inshore fish harvesters from Change Islands, Newfoundland","Our investigation examines the perspectives of fish harvesters on key challenges facing the inshore fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador. The findings, based primarily on in-depth interviews with harvesters in the town of Change Islands, show that fishers are deeply concerned about ineffective regulations, low prices for their catch, and rationalization policies. They explain how existing regulations restrict traditional cooperative fishing practices and impose rules that are not suited for local environmental conditions. Low prices for fish landed, they argue, are caused in part by lack of competition among buyers and a bonus system that favours larger enterprises. These conditions, combined with policies aimed at reducing the fishing fleet and barriers to youth involvement, threaten the long-term survival of coastal communities. Overall, current policies keep inshore harvesters on the sidelines of an increasingly industrialized fishery. Local fish harvesters have valuable local, place-based knowledge that can be used to develop more effective fishery management policies and marketing strategies, and in this article we share their recommendations on how to build more sustainable fisheries. However, traditional fishing communities - along with the potential social, cultural, economic, and environmental benefits of smaller-scale, community-based fishing - need to become more visible for these changes to occur.

537,Local level sustainability planning for livelihoods: A Cambodian experience,"How do Cambodian villagers perceive sustainability and what do they do 'on the ground'? Looking at sustainability issues through the lens of two local resource management committees, and using a triangulation of social science research methods, this paper examines the roles and responsibilities of these groups and how they grapple with resource degradation and related activities. The committees have experimented with a range of resource management strategies, from creating fishing sanctuaries to resolving fishing gear theft. The results indicate that one reason villagers are willing to engage in community-based management is when they believe that they can improve livelihoods within their community. Community-based management is being carried out in the absence of formal legislation; it is recognized through government policy and administrative approvals. In this regard, local-level support and leadership has been key, and the current arrangement has created the political space for experimentation and learning.

539,"Seahorses helped drive creation of marine protected areas, so what did these protected areas do for the seahorses?","In marine environments, charismatic or economically valued taxa have been used as flagships to garner local support or international funds for the establishment and management of marine protected areas (MPAs). Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are frequently used as flagship species to help engender support for the creation of small community-managed no-take MPAs in the central Philippines. It is thus vital to determine whether such MPAs actually have an effect on seahorse abundance, reproductive status and size. A survey of seahorses inside and immediately adjacent to eight MPAs, and in four distant unprotected fishing areas, showed these MPAs had no significant effect on seahorse densities; although densities in and near MPAs were higher than in the distant fished sites, seahorse densities did not change over time. Seahorse size did show a marginal reserve effect, with slightly larger seahorses being found inside MPAs as compared to the distant unprotected fishing areas, but, in general, MPAs had little impact on seahorse size. Although MPAs may eliminate local fishing pressure, they may not reduce other threats such as pollution or destructive fishing outside the reserves. Other recovery tools, such as ecosystem-based management, habitat restoration and limits on destructive fishing outside of MPAs, may be necessary to rebuild seahorse populations. The effects of MPAs depend on species, as well as conditions outside the reserve boundaries. MPA management objectives must thus be clearly and realistically articulated to the communities, especially if support for an MPA was derived at least partly to conserve a particular flagship species.

540,Community-based conservation strategies to end open access: The case of Fish Refuges in Mexico,"Secure property rights are often seen as a precondition of incentives for long-term sustainable use by communities dependent on natural resources. Securing formal property rights can be challenging in coastal small-scale fisheries, which often operate under open access conditions. We argue that insecure, informal rights can offer one pathway for property-rights regime change, and may also provide greater flexibility for developing sustainable fishing practices compatible with climate change adaptation, among other policy-relevant outcomes. The process of establishing short-term but renewable area-based conservation tools, such as the Fish Refuges of Baja California Sur, Mexico, offers the opportunity to examine how community-based strategies can generate incentives for conservation despite the lack of secure property rights. Using in-depth qualitative methods, socioeconomic surveys, and ecological data from 2009 to 2019, we studied the process of engagement among fishers, civil society, and government. We focused on understanding the emerging transition from a scenario of open access and limited withdrawal property rights, toward locals' attaining of insecure defacto management and exclusion property rights and longer-term visions of resource use and conservation. Altogether, this case illustrates the potential and limitations of Fish Refuges as an area-based fisheries and conservation tool. Ã‚Â© 2020 The Authors.

542,"Rivers as resources, rivers as borders: Community and transboundary management of fisheries in the Upper Zambezi River floodplains","This article examines the recent convergence of community-based and transboundary natural resource management in Africa. We suggest that both approaches have potential application to common-pool resources such as floodplain fisheries. However, a merging of transboundary and community-based management may reinforce oversimplifications about heterogeneity in resources, users, and institutions. A scalar mismatch between the ecosystem of concern in transboundary management and local resources of concern in community-based management, as well as different colonial and post-colonial histories contribute to this heterogeneity. We describe a fishery shared by Namibia and Zambia in terms of hybrid fisheries management. We examine settlement patterns, fishermen characteristics, sources of conflict, and perceptions regarding present and potential forms of fisheries management in the area. We also consider the implications that initiatives to manage resources on the local and ecosystem scale have for these fishing livelihoods. Our findings indicate that important social factors, such as the unequal distribution of population and fishing effort, as well as mixed opinions regarding present and future responsibility for fisheries management will complicate attempts to implement a hybrid community-transboundary management initiative.

543,Fishers who don't fish: Precarity and distributive labor on Chile's coastal frontier,"In 2018, an unprecedented red tide prompted Chile's Ministry of Health to close fisheries throughout the country's southern AysÃƒÂ©n Region. The disaster heightened the precarity of Ã¢â‚¬Å“paper fishers,Ã¢â‚¬Â or those who seldom fish but deftly navigate Chile's neoliberal fisheries management system. Amid the crisis, these fishers performed valuable distributive labor. They connected benefits from transferable fishing quotas to community-based networks, persuaded officials to recognize additional claimants, and redistributed cash in their communities. This enabled fishers to access public funds when fishing was impossible and strengthened community solidarity in the face of precarity. Yet it also required that claims for financial compensation be legible to state officials, and it prevented political actions that would have disrupted the state-backed aquaculture industry, despite the latter's contribution to the red tide. Thus, neoliberal distributive programs that depend on the commodification of nature simultaneously benefit rural communities in crisis and facilitate the displacement of beneficiaries.

544,"Investigation of the Negombo estuary (Sri Lanka) brush park fishery, with an emphasis on community-based management","The Negombo estuary brush park fishery in Sri Lanka was investigated from June 1998 to March 1999. The mean fish yield (all species) in the fishery was 12.46 t ha-1 yr-1. Fin fish species formed about 91% of the yield and the rest was formed by penaeid shrimps and crabs. Fish yield and the twig density in the brush park exhibited a second order polynomial relationship indicating a minimum yield at an intermediate value of twig density in the brush parks. The relationship between fish yield and duration of implantation of brush parks showed an optimal period of 30-40 days for high fish yields. Income levels of fishermen, availability of construction material and suitable sites for implantation of brush parks are some of the factors determining size and number of brush parks per fisherman and duration of installation. Indigenous knowledge within the fishing community about the effect of salinity variations, twig density and mangrove species used on the harvests greatly contribute to effective operation of this fishing practice. Cultivation of mangroves to obtain twigs and branches is a unique feature in this estuary. Indigenous knowledge on mangroves has led to the adoption of sound silvicultural practices. Although cultivating mono-specific mangrove stands may not increase diversity of mangrove forests, it reduces denudation of naturally occurring mangrove forests because of brush park construction, and retains habitats for other organisms. Mangrove management plans in the Negombo estuary should therefore be viewed and treated in an integrated manner that takes into account both resource and social components.",NA,No,"The research is based in Sri Lanka, not in any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is clearly about a case study in Sri Lanka, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

545,Effects of computerized physician order entry on medication turnaround time and orders requiring pharmacist intervention,"Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that computerized physician order entry (CPOE) of prescriptions reduces both turnaround time (TAT) and medication errors. However, these studies have been performed primarily in large academic centers with a relatively small number of medication orders. As such, many studies investigating the impact of CPOE on the level of pharmacist intervention have yielded conflicting results. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of CPOE on medication order TAT and the frequency of medication orders requiring pharmacist intervention in a community-based medical center. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a community-based medical center. A total of 24,767 prescriptions written for 940 patients over a six-month period were stratified into CPOE or non-CPOE (handwritten) cohorts. TAT between cohorts were tested using analysis of variance and Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test. The number of orders requiring pharmacist intervention was compared between cohorts and tested using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Medication orders requiring pharmacist intervention were stratified by patient characteristics, therapeutic class, and types of medication error. Results: Medication orders not using CPOE were approximately 8 times more likely to require pharmacist intervention (2.26% versus 0.29%; P<0.001), with the majority of pharmacist interventions performed to prevent medication errors. The overall mean TAT for medication orders was significantly shorter in the CPOE group in comparison with the non-CPOE group (22.2Ã‚Â±86.5min versus 81Ã‚Â±256.7min; P<0.001). CPOE orders nearly eliminated medication errors with wrong dosage forms and formulary issues. Conclusions: Medication orders entered via CPOE are associated with a significant reduction in medication TAT and less likely to require pharmacist intervention. Use of CPOE may improve quality of patient care and efficiency of health care delivery.

546,Combining natural history collections with fisher knowledge for community-based conservation in Fiji,"Harnessing the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of local communities has the potential to enhance conservation planning in developing regions. Marine protected areas (MPAs) that incorporate traditional beliefs about reef tenure are generally more successful in reaching conservation goals and ensuring the participation of local fishermen on vulnerable tropical reef systems. Fiji possesses a unique system of traditional reef management in which local clans or villages, called mataqali, control individual units of a reef, known as qoliqoli, and make independent management decisions based on traditional beliefs and conservation concerns. This is an example of a system, known as customary marine tenure, which has attracted interest from conservation scientists hoping to set up MPAs in vulnerable regions. As one example of this grassroots participation, Nagigi village on the Fijian island of Vanua Levu has expressed interest in setting up an MPA in part of its qoliqoli because of concerns about overfishing. In response to this interest, we took a two-pronged approach to assessing Nagigi's fishery status and conservation needs, first conducting a fishery-independent species survey using destructive sampling and then focusing on fisheries targets identified through fisher interviews. These interviews allowed us to identify heavily targeted species, assess villagers' understanding of reef dynamics over 30 or 40 years of fisheries expansion, and evaluate village support and expectations for a proposed conservation program. Based on our findings we recommend a temporary closure to be in effect for at least three years, allowing one of the more important fishery targets, Lethrinus harak (ForsskÃƒÂ¥l, 1775; Lethrinidae), to complete at least one generation within the reserve. The methodology of matching the proposed marine protected area with the life histories and ecologies of heavily targeted species identified through fisherman and -woman interviews can offer a template for future conservation projects that seek to synthesize indigenous peoples' needs and knowledge with ecological data.

547,"Dynamics of fish assemblages on coral reefs subjected to different management regimes in the Abrolhos Bank, eastern Brazil","1. Marine protected areas (MPAs) range from multiple-use areas (MUA) to absolute no-take reserves (NTR). Despite their importance for fisheries management, there are few long-term studies comparing benefits from different types of MPAs within the same region. 2. Fish assemblages were monitored for five years (2001-2005) in the largest coral reefs in the South Atlantic (Abrolhos Bank, Brazil). Monitoring included one community-based MUA, two NTRs (one established in 1983 and another in 2001), and one unprotected area. Benthic assemblages at these areas, as well as fish assemblages on unprotected deeper reefs (25-35 m), were monitored from 2003 onwards. 3. Habitat characteristics strongly influenced fish assemblages' structure. This, together with the lack of data from before establishment of the MPAs, did not allow an unequivocal analysis of the effects of the MPAs. 4. Biomass of commercially important fish, particularly small carnivores, was higher in the older NTR. Biomass of black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci increased by 30-fold inside NTRs during the study period, while remaining consistently low elsewhere. 5. A single herbivore species, the parrotfish Scarus trispinosus, dominated fish assemblages (28.3% of total biomass). Biomass of this species increased in 2002 on the younger NTR and on the MUA, soon after establishment of the former and banning of the parrotfish fishery in the latter. This increase was followed by a decline from 2003 onwards, after increased poaching and reopening of the parrotfish fishery. 6. Fish biomass increased in 2002 across the entire region. This increase was stronger in sites closer to deeper reefs, where fish biomass was up to 30-times higher than shallow reefs: movement of fish from deeper to shallower areas may have played a role. 7. The effective use of MPAs in the Abrolhos Bank is still dependent on adequate enforcement and the protection of critical habitats such as deep reefs and mangroves.

We present results from a collaborative community-based research program established to build research capacity and address pressing research questions. Using otoliths extracted from fish caught by community monitors along the Peel River, we investigated migratory patterns using the isotopic ratio, 87Sr/86Sr. Applying a hidden Markov model to the otolith laser ablation transects, we explored emergent model states and linked them to regions of the watershed. Across and within individuals, fish occupied the ocean and three different identified freshwater locations; however, while all fish were captured in the Peel River, none expressed an otolith signature that would suggest they grew there. Across individuals, we found large variability in migratory patterns, suggesting that migrations are not obligate and that individual fish utilize the watershed very differently. This diversity may buffer whitefish and reliant human communities against change, but indicates dependence on a large, intact watershed.

551,Role of docosahexaenoic acid in maternal and child mental health,"Mental health problems in women and children represent a significant public health problem worldwide, especially in developing countries. The role of nutrition as a cost-effective approach in the prevention and management of these conditions has received recent attention, particularly nutrients such as iron, zinc, and n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids, which play a role in brain structure and function. The objective of this article was to review current evidence on the relation between n-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and maternal and child mental health disorders. Human studies published in English were identified from Medline databases (1966 to June 2008) by using key search terms and review articles. A summary of the role of DHA in the human brain is followed by a review of human studies, both observational and intervention trials, that examine the relation between n-3 fatty acids such as DHA and depression and child mental health disorders. Observational studies support a direct association between poor n-3 fatty acid status and increased risk of maternal depression and childhood behavioral disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, evidence from intervention trials is weak. Most of the studies reviewed had small sample sizes and were conducted in clinically diagnosed samples, with no placebo-controlled groups. Little is known about the benefits of DHA in the prevention of maternal depression and ADHD. Large, well-designed, community-based prevention trials are needed.

553,"The effectiveness of community-based governance of small-scale fisheries, Ngazidja island, Comoros","Conventional top-down, exogenous approaches to fisheries management have been ineffective in more traditional and small-scale fisheries. Yet, there remains little understanding of the effectiveness of alternative approaches. This case-study of small-scale fisheries in the Comoros examines how effective local fishing associations are at managing common fisheries resources, and provides some understanding of the underlying characteristics of effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on assessing governance effectiveness according to characteristics appropriate within the local context, and on suggesting ways to enhance local institutional strength and capacity to manage resources. Qualitative methods were used to collect data on local governance structures and management tools, fishers' knowledge and beliefs, and perceptions of the status of fisheries resources in four major fishing villages on the island of Ngazidja. Results show that fisheries management in the Comoros is informally shared between the State fisheries department, a national fishing syndicate, and village fishing associations. Village fishing associations play an active role in fisheries management by collectively designing, monitoring, and enforcing local regulations. Compliance with local regulations is high, primarily due to participatory decision-making, community-monitoring, and strong feelings of solidarity among fishers. Perceptions of the benefits of these regulations are also high. This suggests that by working within these pre-established informal management systems, collective governance of common pool resources can be achieved within communities, and feelings of empowerment and shared responsibility among resource users can lead to effective management practices.

554,Net benefits: The ecological restoration of inland fisheries in Bangladesh,"The Centre for Natural Resources Studies (CNRS), since 1992, has implemented community-based environmental restoration projects in Bangladesh that seek to protect and renew floodplain ecosystems. These efforts grew out of a situation where the country's aquatic resources were under assault by massive flood control projects. The CNRS strategy was inspired by research showing that the rural poor in Bangladesh rely on a rich diversity of fish species for their diets and livelihoods. Most of these fish species depend on the annual inundation of flood waters for their reproduction and growth. Yet these crucial social and biological realities were either unseen or ignored by the leading development agencies concerned with water management, flood control and fisheries in Bangladesh. The CNRS projects have shown that an alternative strategy, based on investment in ecological restoration, can benefit both the fish and people. Inland Fisheries in Bangladesh In his classic book, Fish, Water and People: Reflections on Inland Openwater Fisheries Resources of Bangladesh, the late Dr. M. Youssouf Ali described the link between fisheries and rural livelihoods in the Bengal delta: Bangladesh has the reputation of being very rich in inland openwater capture fisheries production. A large number of fish and prawns could be captured by men, women, and children at their doorsteps during the monsoon season, when all the low-lying areas of the country remained under floodwater. As a result of the plentiful availability of inland-water fish production, fish constituted the second most important component of the Bengali's diet next to rice. Bengali people have been known to be made up of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrice and fishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ali 1997). Ã‚Â© 2007 James K. Boyce, Sunita Narain, and Elizabeth A.

555,Scaling territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) in Belize,"Belize recently committed to establishing territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs), called ""managed access"" in Belize, throughout its territorial waters. While more remains to be done to ensure that scaling is successful, this national commitment and the design of a national system of managed access areas are important milestones in the expansion of rights-based fishery management in Belize. Theoretica l work and empirica l studies have y ielded principles for scaling conservation innovations, many of which were applied in Belize over 3 yrs to achieve these milestones. Two pilot sites were established in 2011 and encompassed varied ecological and social conditions to maximize learning applicable to scaling to diverse sites. Participatory processes were used to identify fishery management challenges as perceived by fishers, managers, and other stakeholders, and to build consensus on solutions. A scaling team consisting of fishers, scientists, non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, and government representatives with dedicated resources for scaling was formed. Our case study suggests that scaling principles derived from theoretical considerations and empirical analysis have contributed to the scaling of managed access in Belize, which is expected to result in significant conservation, social, and economic benefits. This in turn suggests that these principles may be relatively robust and perhaps can be applied elsewhere to scale conservation initiatives. Our case study also suggests that careful consideration of new information and changing conditions accompanied by appropriate decisions and changes in tactics and strategy are important for successful scaling.

556,"Fishing in the dark-local knowledge, night spearfishing and spawning aggregations in the Western Solomon Islands","Within the marine conservation community there is considerable interest in combining local knowledge and science to achieve management objectives. Yet there remain few studies which have examined the merits and caveats of local knowledge, or shown how combining both knowledge systems has resulted in better management outcomes. This study outlines collaborative efforts to conserve fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) in Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon Islands. Baseline information on FSAs was obtained through local knowledge and spearfishing creel surveys. This information provided the starting point for establishing a 2-year community-based underwater monitoring program at the largest known FSA in Roviana Lagoon, where the brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus) co-aggregate. This participatory research shows that local knowledge on FSAs is utilised to maximise returns from fishing, with spearfishermen targeting aggregations at night during the lunar periods when abundances peak. Because of its shallow distribution P. areolatus is the most vulnerable of the three groupers to nighttime spearfishing, with two fishermen capable of removing 15-30% of the total spawning biomass in two nights. Underwater monitoring demonstrates that while fishermen provided accurate information on many aspects of FSAs, their knowledge on spawning seasons was inaccurate for the FSA reported on here. Peak aggregations occurred from December to April each year, which differs from the traditionally recognised grouper season of October to January. A combination of local knowledge and science was used to develop appropriate management measures for this FSA, with the aggregation declared a community-based marine protected area (MPA) in 2006.

557,"Assessment of sustainable utilization of ecosystem services in different stages of mangrove forest restoration at klong khone sub-district, Samut Songkhram province, Thailand","Understanding the function of the ecological restoration of mangrove forests leads to appropriate sustainable utilization (SU) of ecosystem services (ES) during development stages of mangrove ecosystem for sustaining the local livelihood and maintaining the mangrove ecological production. The study aims to identify the SU which was changed relying a development of ES at Klong Khone (KK) Sub-district, Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand. The SU was collected by in-depth interview with 20 key respondents, questionnaires survey with 140 fishermen and statistical scientific data on developed mangrove forest areas. Descriptive statistics and event analysis were employed to analyze the data. The study found that bottom-up management tools based on a local peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participation were applied to determine a way of harvest of ES. An application of these local tools including a common property right, land use zoning, application of local knowledge, human resources, and financial and technological transfer resulted in different utilizing activities of ES during the development of mangrove forest restoration stages. The results showed that the ES produced during mangrove stand initiation stage were mainly harvested for food (90%) and during the young forest regrowth stage (87%) (N = 140). They were also widely used for operating aquaculture during mangrove stand initiation stage (39%), but they were harvested with more concerns about environmental impacts during the young forest regrowth stage (47%) (N = 140). The cultural services during young forest regrowth stage were increasingly utilized for diversified incomes from ecotourism (46%) and education learning program (50%) (N = 140). The ES from developed mangrove forest were harvested effectively based on an application of SU tools which were locally developed by local peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participation.

559,Understanding social-ecological change and transformation through community perceptions of system identity,"We developed an empirical approach to consider social-ecological system change and transformation by drawing on resource usersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ knowledge and perceptions. We applied this approach in the Cau Hai lagoon, a coastal area dominated by small-scale fisheries in central Vietnam. Nine focus groups with more than 70 fishers were used to gather information about key social-ecological system elements and interactions, historical social-ecological dynamics, and possible thresholds between distinct social-ecological system identities. The patterns of change in livelihoods and resource exploitation in the Cau Hai lagoon are similar to those seen in other coastal lagoon and small-scale fishery contexts. Our findings show some promise for the use of local knowledge and the perceptions of resource user communities to understand and characterize social-ecological transformations. Importantly, however, we also demonstrate how social-ecological transformations are complicated processes driven by many factors beyond the control of any singular individual or group. We argue that (1) the occurrence of social-ecological transformations can result in either positive or negative outcomes and (2) that we need to direct our thinking away from drawing tidy conclusions about if and when social-ecological transformations take place. Our research also encourages scholars to carefully consider how we frame the benefits of participatory, community-based governance initiatives. Importantly, we need to examine the ways that governance initiatives will be beneficial for some people and detrimental for others, and we need to be fully aware of locally contested interests and acknowledge competing priorities for fisheries management and human well-being.

There is little research regarding the geographical and organizational characteristics associated with participation. Objective: We examined the factors associated with community-based veterans service organization (VSO) units' decision to participate in a health promotion project. Methods: We collected location and organizational characteristics regarding 218 VSO units asked to participate in POWER, a partnership to improve hypertension selfmanage ment skills between the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) and Wisconsin branches of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Vietnam Veterans of America, and National Association of Black Veterans. We tested the association of these characteristics with participation using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, and analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors independently associated with participation. Results: In bivariable analyses, likelihood of participation was positively associated with increasing membership (p <.001), meeting attendance (p< .001), publication of an organizational newsletter (p< .001), presence of a women's auxiliary (p= .02), and location within 44 miles of the VAMC (p= .047). On multivariable analysis, only meeting attendance and census tract-level educational attainment predicted participation.

Maintenance of healthy zoobenthos community is essential for water ecosystems remediation. Understanding the hydrology and water quality factors that drive the variation of zoobenthos is the priority for water ecosystems remediation. The present study used canonical correlation analysis to select the main habitat factors affecting zoobenthic communities based on field sampling of the river zoobenthos in the first pilot city for the construction of civilized water ecosystems in ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â€Jinan City. In addition, analysis was performed based on geoscience methods of Global Moran's I and Anselin local Moran's I spatial autocorrelation of main habitats factors.

563,Inland fisheries of tropical Africa,"African inland fisheries face many challenges resulting from rapid population growth, and the abundance and demography of fish species have changed through fishing. Some stocks are overfished and the regulation of fishing effort is a management priority. The socio-economic impacts of effort reduction necessitate the search for new solutions. These include the search for unexploited stocks or introducing non-native species. Fisheries are affected by events in catchment areas, such as deforestation and soil erosion, and eutrophication and pollution. These affect fish population in various ways although eutrophication can increase productivity. Climate change may alter rainfall patterns that could reduce fish production in areas where rainfall is expected to decline. Existing management has been ineffective, and community-based co-management systems have yet to prove themselves.

564,Community management yields positive impacts for coastal fisheries resources and biodiversity conservation,"Combining no-take marine reserves with exclusive access by communities to unreserved waters could provide the required incentives for community management to achieve positive impacts. However, few protected areas have been critically evaluated for their impact, which involves applying counterfactual thinking to predict conditions within protected areas if management had never occurred. Here, we use statistical matching to conduct a rigorous impact evaluation of dual management systems on coral reef fishes in Tonga, with communities having both full no-take areas and areas of exclusive fishing rights. No-take areas generally had positive impacts on the species richness, biomass, density, and size of target reef fish, while exclusive access areas were similar to predicted counterfactual conditions. The latter is likely because overall fishing pressure in exclusive access areas might not actually change, although more fish could be exploited by communities with access rights.

565,The impact of shrimp farming on mangrove ecosystems,"Farmed shrimp production and value continue to increase with Asia producing the global majority of shrimp and the USA, Japan and Europe being the main importers. Shrimp farming systems are very diverse in their management, size and impacts. There are many causes for mangrove loss but the conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms has caused considerable attention. The major issues of shrimp farming include the loss of important ecological and socio-economic functions of mangrove ecosystems, changes in hydrology, salinization, introduction of non-native species and diseases, pollution from effluents, chemicals and medicines, use of wild fish for feed, capture of wild shrimp seed and loss of livelihoods and social conflicts. Global awareness about the need to reduce the impacts of shrimp farming and the importance of sustainable use of mangrove eco-systems has led to a number of guidelines being published. Policy to position shrimp farms behind mangroves can be effective but also requires good institutional capacity and coordination, effective enforcement, incentives, land tenure and participation of all stakeholders for success. Better management practices have been identified which reduce impacts, increase efficiency and profits. Community-based management using partnerships, stewardships or multilateral cooperation schemes, together with integrated, mixed or mangrove-friendly aquaculture practices and mangrove rehabilitation should also be promoted. Introduction of certification schemes may further ensure environmental sustainability, social equity and food safety of aquaculture products that can benefit both the local communities and the consumer.

566,Can we reach agreement on a standardized approach to ecosystem-based fishery management?,"In the 25 yrs since the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act was passed, substantial agreement has been reached about how to manage single-species fisheries in the U.S. Biological reference points, such as the biomass that will produce maximum sustained fisheries yield, are estimated from fairly standardized kinds of fisheries models, and management regulations such as quotas are set according to control rules based on these reference points. Debate about the specifics of single-species fisheries management takes place within this basic framework. However, the objectives, principles, goals, and scientific methodology of ecosystem-based management are in an early stage of development, and no standardized approach currently exists. Ecosystem-based management regimes may run the gamut from a suite of single-species reference points to that based on reference points that measure some level of ecosystem function (e.g., measures of biodiversity). Management regimes that do not rely upon quantitative reference points, such as systems of marine protected areas, gear restrictions, or community-based management, have also been referred to as ecosystem-based management.

567,The implications of differing tourist/resident perceptions for community-based resource management: a Hawaiian coastal resource area study,"Despite globally increasing interest in restoring local-level management of natural resources, few studies examine differences between residents' and tourists' place connections and implications for community-based natural resource management. This article reports findings from a survey (n = 264) in Haena, Kauai, Hawaii, where resource management is shifting from state-level government to local residents. Tasked with creating new, local-level rules governing use of coastal resources, Haena community members must consider the perspectives, resource use, and values of residents as well as of multiple, diverse user groups including the burgeoning tourist population. We found significant differences in how residents and tourists learn about the area; the activities in which they engage; their perceptions of resource health; who they think is responsible for caretaking of resources; and their views of personal responsibilities to the place. The findings have implications for local-level resource management and use of popular tourist destinations including the importance of guidebooks in mediating visitor perceptions of a place, the possibility of concurrent but separate visitor and resident use of the same area, visitors' and residents' sense of responsibility to mitigate impacts of their actions, and the potential of engaging residents' place caretaking preferences toward more organized community-based resource management efforts.

569,Deciphering contextual influences on local leadership in community-based fisheries management,"Community-based fisheries management (CBFM) strategies have been adopted in a variety of small-scale fisheries around the world. Within these management structures, leaders are increasingly regarded as essential for viable CBFM yet systematic analysis into the intricate mechanisms of leadership are limited. This paper aims to identify key knowledge gaps of leadership in CBFM by strategically reviewing research from fisheries and natural resource management, and from other sectors. The focus is on the interaction between leaders, their connections with and beyond their communities, and the context within which leaders function. Insights from over 30 case studies suggest previous work on leaders and leadership generally focused on relatively coarse-scale characteristics of leadership and the functions that leaders perform. Ecological and social context influence leaders[U+05F3] ability to help deliver successful CBFM. The personal and professional attributes of leaders themselves may be beneficial or inhibitory for CBFM depending on that context. It is therefore essential that future research builds on current insight in order to decipher the implications of contextual influences on local leadership and, by extension, the level of CBFM success.

With an increase in the volume of information in a world of diversity and complexity, students find it difficult to comprehend the information received, to form personal meanings. The purpose of the study is to identify the features of students ' value orientations, to experimentally prove the effectiveness of involving students in various practices of social participation as a significant factor in the formation of value relations in the educational system. The methodological basis of the research is the cultural and historical theory of L. S. Vygotsky. The study involved 365 students aged 11 to 18 years, studying in general education organizations. The empirical basis is based on projective techniques: ""Unfinished situation"", ""Fantastic choice"", the method of free choice of presented answers (N. E. Shchurkova). For statistical processing of the results of the study, the Fisher criterion was applied. The formation of students ' value relations was built up in the process of involving them in various practices of social participation as the inclusion of students in socially useful activities for the benefit of specific people and the social environment as a whole. Significant changes were found in the cognitive (in fifth and seventh graders - p < 0.05; in tenth graders - p < 0.01), emotional (in fifth and seventh graders - p < 0.05), and practically effective (in all age groups-p < 0.05) components of value orientations. The tenth-graders showed positive dynamics in the emotional component of value orientations, but no significant changes were revealed. The effectiveness of students ' involvement in the practice of social participation is considered not as a fait accompli, but as a dynamic process, as a result of which the student develops the ability to be a subject of his own life in the conditions of social childhood. The study proves the need to involve students in social activities in child-adult communities based on the school. As a result, the understanding of life is carried out more effectively, on the basis of taking into account the interests of another person, the emotional sphere of the student develops, the student consistently masters the experience of social life with the support of a significant adult.

Even if ecotourism provides a significant new source of income through environmentally friendly, nonconsumptive resource use, it may not by sufficient to discourage local people from engaging in other, more destructive forms of consumptive resource use. But resource conflicts may not preclude efforts to promote conservation through ecotourism.

The activities were carried out through registered Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in three locations in Kerala, India during 2005-2008. Data was collected before and after the project periods through interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire containing statements indicating the adequacy, quality and diversity of food materials. Fifty respondents each were randomly selected from the three communities, thereby resulting in a total sample size of 150. The data was analysed using SPSS by adopting statistical tools like frequency, average, percentage analysis, t - test and regression. Participatory planning and implementation of diverse interventions notably intercropping and off-farm activities along with nutrition education brought out significant improvements in the food and nutritional security, in terms of frequency and quantity of consumption as well as diet diversity.

574,Multi-stakeholder process of co-designing small-scale fisheries policy in South Africa,"In 2005, a group of researchers, community-based organizations and lawyers got together with small-scale fishers to launch a class action law suit against the government of South Africa in its allocation system of Individual Transferable Quotas, on the ground that the system was unfair to small-scale fishing communities and threatened their right to practise their livelihoods. This effort resulted in the cabinet adoption of a new small-scale fisheries policy in 2014, with amendments being made to fisheries law (the Marine Living Resource Act 18 of 1998) to accommodate the issues and concerns of small-scale fisheries. Draft regulations and an implementation plan have recently been released, paving the way for the implementation of small-scale fisheries allocations in 2016. These legal and policy shifts are of great significance for small-scale fisheries, both in South Africa and elsewhere, and deserve careful examination. This paper discusses the processes leading to the development of a new small-scale fisheries policy and what has followed since. Specifically, the analysis focuses on a variety of collaborations between scholars from different disciplines; researchers from multiple fields; community practitioners representing diverse professional and community perspectives; and community organizations across local, state, national and international levels.

576,Governing enclosure for coastal communities: Social embeddedness in a Canadian shrimp fishery,"Critical analyses of neoliberalism[U+05F3]s influence on fisheries governance have documented how enclosure, quota leasing and renting, and commodification can precipitate negative social consequences for fishing communities. By contrast, this paper draws on the concept of embeddedness to argue that certain policies and social relations can regulate enclosure, quota renting, and commodification in ways that empower community-based groups to facilitate the anchoring of fishery resources and wealth in coastal communities. It does so through an analysis of northern shrimp fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, between the 1970s and the early 2000s. This case study illustrates how fisheries enclosure policies informed by geographically and morally defined principles of access and equity and limits on commodification can meaningfully embed fishery resources and benefits in rural and remote coastal regions that depend on small-scale fishing. Although the application of social principles continues to be marginalized in the context of neoliberal policy regimes that privilege individual economic efficiency over distributive concerns, this paper provides new insight into the conditions under which principles of ethical allocation and distribution of resources are able to persist through an era of neoliberalism.

577,Reconciling social justice and ecosystem-based management in the wake of a successful predator reintroduction,"The reintroduction of a previously extirpated predator can engender conflict when the reintroduced species depletes customary fisheries to which indigenous communities have constitutionally protected rights. In the case of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) recovery on the west coast of North America, not only is CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Species at Risk Act in conflict with Indigenous rights, but it also illuminates gaps in the principles of ecosystem-based management (EBM), such as equity and social justice. Broadly, we ask in this paper how EBM might be advanced if Indigenous communities were viewed as components of ecosystems having rights to a sustainable future equal to other components. Specifically, we explore evidence of sea otter management among precontact Northwest Coast societies and a contemporary co-managed system proposed by the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations that would combine research with refinement of traditional hunting practices. We show that barriers persist through lack of knowledge of past controlled hunts, ignorance of recent experiences of successful community-based clam management, distrust of Indigenous capacity to self-manage or co-manage a hunt, and divergent values among actors.

578,Conservation in a Crisis: Marine Resource Management Authority and Legitimacy during Political Instability in Madagascar,"This study explores how the 2009 political crisis in Madagascar influenced local access to, and claims over, marine resources within marine protected areas. It focuses specifically on how different conservation actors constructed and maintained authority over each protected area. Surveys conducted in 2010 show how community-managed protected areas had a lower incidence of resource use rule infractions during the crisis than state-managed areas. Drawing from in-depth qualitative research conducted from 2009 to 2015, I argue that this occurred due to the discursive framing of 'community authority' over protected areas as well as the social relationships with, and material benefits communities received from, international conservation organisations working in the community-managed areas. In contrast, I argue that state-managed marine protected area rules were transgressed more due to the symbolic and physical ousting of state authority underpinning a fear-based relationship between the state managers and community members. Ultimately, this work points to the importance of understanding how different conservation actors construct and maintain authority over marine resources.

580,Institutional effects on ecological outcomes of community-based management of fisheries in the Amazon,"Communities throughout the globe are increasingly being given the responsibility of resource management, making it necessary to understand the factors that lead to success in community-based management (CBM). Here, we assessed whether and how institutional design principles affect the ecological outcomes of CBM schemes for Arapaima sp., an important common-pool fishery resource of the Amazon Basin. We quantified the degree of presence of OstromÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (Science 325:419Ã¢â‚¬â€œ422, 1990) institutional design principles in 83 communities using a systematic survey, and quantitatively linked the design principles to a measure of ecological outcome (arapaima density) in a subset of 39 communities to assess their influence. To understand regional patterns of institutional capacity for CBM, we evaluated the degree of presence of each principle in all 83 communities. The principle scores were positively related to arapaima density in the 39 CBM schemes, explaining about half of the variation. Design principles related to defined boundaries and graduated sanctions exerted the strongest influence on the capacity of CBM to increase arapaima density. The degree to which most principles were present in all 83 communities was generally low, however, with the two most influential principles (defined boundaries and graduated sanctions) being the least present of all. Although the roles of the other principles (management rules, conflict resolution, collective action, and monitoring systems) are probably important, our results indicate that efforts aimed atÃ‚Â strengthening the presence of defined boundaries and graduated sanctions in communities hold promise to improve the effectiveness of arapaima CBM regionally.

581,Can community-based adaptation increase resilience?,"A central claim of community-based adaptation (CBA) is that it increases resilience. Yet, the concept of resilience is treated inconsistently in CBA, obscuring discussion of the limitations and benefits of resilience thinking and undermining evaluation of resilience outcomes in target communities. This paper examines different participatory assessment activities carried out as part of CBA case studies in Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands. The activities and their outputs were assessed against 10 characteristics of resilience previously identified in a systematic review. The findings offer support to the claim that CBA can build resilience in target communities, revealing the inherent strengths of CBA in relation to resilience. However, it is necessary for CBA assessments to simultaneously incorporate activities that consider cultural, political, economic and ecological factors influencing resilience within and between communities. This may demand multiple staff with different skills. The findings also highlight the importance of politics and power in shaping adaptive capacity. In particular, addressing the highly context specific nature of social, cultural and political relations demands an approach that is situated in and responsive to local realities. Overall, our case studies suggest that using the 10 characteristics as an analytical framework offers support to practitioners looking to develop, implement or evaluate CBA assessment activities. Yet within this, it is critical that a focus on increasing resilience through CBA does not preclude transformation in social relations. Realising the potential to support resilience and transformation requires CBA practitioners to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of resilience, whilst also paying close attention to multiple potential barriers to equitable adaptation.

The cooperatives hold exclusive rights to 'concession' territories for major fisheries and are linked by geographic adjacency and through a federation. The case study underscores the role of factors such as smallness of scale; the productivity, visibility and legibility of the resources and fisheries involved; clarity of social and territorial boundaries; adjacency and linkages among territorial units; a strong sense of community. The cooperatives also made considerable investments in attaining high levels of knowledge, leadership, transparent and democratic decision-making, and ""vigilance,"" or enforcement of the rules and the running of the organization.

585,"ASSESSMENT of SEAGRASS PERCENT COVER and WATER QUALITY USING UAV IMAGES and FIELD MEASUREMENTS in BOLINAO, PANGASINAN","The sensitivity to changes in water quality inherent to seagrass communities makes them vital for determining the overall health of the coastal ecosystem. Numerous efforts including community-based coastal resource management, conservation and rehabilitation plans are currently undertaken to protect these marine species. In this study, the relationship of water quality parameters, specifically chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and turbidity, with seagrass percent cover is assessed quantitatively. Support Vector Machine, a pixel-based image classification method, is applied to determine seagrass and non-seagrass areas from the orthomosaic which yielded a 91.0369% accuracy. In-situ measurements of chl-a and turbidity are acquired using an infinity-CLW water quality sensor. Geostatistical techniques are utilized in this study to determine accurate surfaces for chl-a and turbidity. In two hundred interpolation tests for both chl-a and turbidity, Simple Kriging (Gaussian-model type and Smooth-neighborhood type) performs best with Mean Prediction equal to-0.1371 FTU and 0.0061 ÃŽÂ¼g/L, Root Mean Square Standardized error equal to-0.0688 FTU and-0.0048 ÃŽÂ¼g/L, RMS error of 8.7699 FTU and 1.8006 ÃŽÂ¼g/L and Average Standard Error equal to 10.8360 FTU and 1.6726 ÃŽÂ¼g/L. Zones are determined using fishnet tool and Moran's I to calculate for the seagrass percent cover. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is used as a regression analysis to quantify the relationship of seagrass percent cover and water quality parameters. The regression analysis result indicates that turbidity has an inverse relationship while chlorophyll-a has a direct relationship with seagrass percent cover.

587,Sustainability analysis of the benthic fisheries managed in the turf system in Chile,"Territorial use rights in fisheries (TURF) are considered to aid to the sustainability of small-scale fisheries, because they remove the perverse incentives, which sustain the tragedy of the commons. Nevertheless, a comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of TURFs is lacking. Chile offers a unique opportunity, because an extensive system for benthic fisheries has been implemented, with at present hundreds of TURFs along the coast. This study analyzes the sustainability of all the TURFs (109) along a stretch of 800 Km of coast, using population, productive, economic, social and institutional indicators. The information was obtained from the technical reports and monitoring each TURF has to prepare for the authority each year, databases the authority has and interviews with artisanal fishermen. Three states of TURFs were identified: unsustainable, poorly sustainable and sustainable. The resources exploited in the analyzed TURFs are the chilean abalon or Ã¢â‚¬Å“locoÃ¢â‚¬Â (Concholepas concholepas), the key hole limpets Ã¢â‚¬Å“lapa negraÃ¢â‚¬Â (Fissurella latimarginata), and Ã¢â‚¬Å“lapa rosadaÃ¢â‚¬Â (Fissurella cumingi), the kelps Ã¢â‚¬Å“huiro negroÃ¢â‚¬Â (Lessonia berteroana), and Ã¢â‚¬Å“huiro paloÃ¢â‚¬Â (Lessonia trabeculata), the surf clam Ã¢â‚¬Å“MachaÃ¢â‚¬Â (Mesodesma donacium), the scallop Ã¢â‚¬Å“ostiÃƒÂ³n del norteÃ¢â‚¬Â (Argopecten purpuratus) and the seaurchin Ã¢â‚¬Å“erizo rojoÃ¢â‚¬Â (Loxechinus albus). Results show general low performance for population, production and economic indicators, but good performance for social and institutional indicators. Overall the system shows a poor sustainability, which principally means unstable populations, landings and income in most of the TURFs. This result, which differs from most published analyses of the system, is explained mainly by the impossibility to reach a stable fishery through management of so small areas, given the natural variability of the species and the general environment. The good performance of some TURFs cannot be explained by a single factor, which is consistent with the complexity of the system, which makes it little amenable for proper management.

588,The context of policy design for existing community-based fisheries management systems in the Pacific Islands,"Community-based fisheries management is being widely promoted as an alternative to centralized systems based on the familiar bioeconomic models that have manifestly failed to prevent a near catastrophic overexploitation of fish stocks worldwide. The Pacific Island Region probably contains the world's greatest concentration of still-functioning traditional community-based systems for managing coastal-marine fisheries and other resources. It has been frequently asserted that many such traditional systems provide both a firm foundation for future coastal fisheries management in the Pacific Islands Region, as well as a conceptual framework for managing fisheries elsewhere. Although now seemingly self-evident to fisheries development 'experts', such assertions remain largely unverified. Whereas it is a relatively straightforward task to distil basic 'design principles' from a sample of systems, it is far more complex to analyze the multi-sectoral national environment in which they function, especially when their history is taken into account. In other words, it is far less widely appreciated that many contemporary community-based fisheries management systems are the end products of a long process of change and adaptation to external pressures and constraints. In this article I address some of the broader contextual issues that should be appreciated in policymaking with respect to a potential modern role for traditional management systems in general, and in the analysis of a future role for any given system. First, the principal external factors that have caused change in systems are described and exemplified. The recognition of the potential role of existing community-based fisheries systems, and attempts to act on it, is summarized for some Pacific Island nations, with a focus on the complex problem of reconciling customary and statutory legal systems. In the final section I examine three principal national policy alternatives regarding the potential role of existing local fisheries management systems, together with three main criteria for determining whether or not a system can be adapted to fulfill modern requirements.",NA,Maybe,"The paper could potentially include a case study from the countries listed in the SC, but it is not explicitly stated in the title or abstract."," Maybe; The abstract mentions Pacific Island nations but does not specify which ones.

589,"Village level institutions at the margins of natural resource management: The case of VDCS in Ngamiland, Botswana","Institutions exercise authority through rules and regulations that determine who is eligible for what and how. In Botswana the institutional landscape consists of the public sector, private enterprises, non-government and community based organisations. These institutions affect people?s pursuance of natural resource-based livelihoods activities such as those related to access to water, land, veldt products, fish, wildlife, grazing grounds, grass thatch and reeds. Informal and formal village level institutions (VLIs) in contemporary Botswana are increasingly becoming important ""bridging institutions"" mediating access to resources and opportunities between public and private sectors. This chapter uses a case study of Village Development Committees (VDCs) in Ngamiland District in northwestern Botswana to assess the extent to which they mediate access to a range of resources especially in rural and remote areas. VDCs in Ngamiland tend to be multipurpose institutions adapting to the emerging challenges of a changing society. Although they are a non-statutory institution, and have no mandate to determine who has access and control over natural resources, VDCs play an indirect advocacy role for the provision of water, facilitate diversification of the local economy, and promote natural resources conservation, good solid waste disposal practices and buffer between top and down decision-making. The extent to which they are able to advocate for resource access effectively depends on the existence of other supportive or complementary resource systems both at local and district levels.

590,Conserving mangroves for their blue carbon: Insights and prospects for community-based mangrove management in southeast Asia,"Mangrove forests of Southeast Asia have significantly decreased to give way to more favored economic activities such as aquaculture production, rice farming, and very recently oil palm plantation development. The severe cover loss implies the serious reduction of essential ecosystem services, particularly climate change mitigation. This chapter therefore sought to synthesize and describe the blue carbon stock potential of the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mangrove forests, in the context of developing community-based payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes that could offset the declining trend. Estimates showed that Southeast Asian mangroves could store as much as a kiloton carbon stock per hectare, an ecosystem value that is worth sustaining. Lessons learned from pilot PES projects has revealed some governance concerns that need to be addressed in order to ensure the benefits and commitment of local communities in forest conservation. These include: (1) clarification of tenure rights; (2) provision of equitable financial incentives to offset mangrove-degrading livelihoods; (3) development of appropriate and acceptable methodologies to account and trade blue carbon credits; (4) inclusion of local needs and interests in PES program and other coastal resource management plans; and (5) ecological considerations in plantation development. Some of the helpful policy and institutional recommendations to overcome these challenges include: (1) stronger incorporation of mangroves into marine protected areas; (2) full adoption of community-based mangrove management approach to further improve local capacities to manage mangroves; and (3) forging private sector partnership to support the blue carbon project.

591,"Marine systematic conservation planning for Rodrigues Island, western Indian Ocean","There is a growing number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that have been selected and designed through participatory processes, following the recognition of the need to increase the involvement of local communities likely to be affected by such developments. In parallel with this shift has been the development of systematic conservation planning (SCP) tools that have increased our capacity to design MPAs to maximise biodiversity outcomes and to scale-up community-based initiatives into more comprehensive MPA networks. In Rodrigues, four Marine Reserves (no-take zones) in the north of the island were identified through participatory processes. A Marine Protected Area (multi-use), South East Marine Protected Area (SEMPA), has also been gazetted in the south of the island through a community-based approach. In order to verify and assess gaps in the stakeholder-based design, a Marine Reserve network was designed using the SCP tool Marxan using available spatial data on marine biotopes and fishing effort (FE) to achieve fisheries benefits and marine biodiversity protection. The Marxan analysis identified that only two of the four marine reserves achieve partly the objectives set and SEMPA contains planning units which can be considered as no take zones. This study shows the importance of using both stakeholder's knowledge and scientific input for a better design of MPAs. The results from the analyses can be used by decision makers to inform decisions in a scientific way by providing a set of scenarios from the Marxan analysis.

This case note focuses on this unique class action brought by the fishers in the Equality Court and the decisions resulting from the case. The relief sought by the fishers to remedy the discrimination and inequity was to compel the then Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism to make proper and adequate provision for artisanal fishers in terms of the fisheries legal framework, giving them equitable access to marine resources alongside other marine resource users. This note evaluates the impact of the order of the Equality Court, as it served as the trigger to transform small-scale fisheries in South Africa.

593,"Diversity of fishery resources and catch efficiency of fishing gears in Gorai River, Bangladesh","Gorai River is one of the important rivers in Bangladesh for rich aquatic biodiversity. The river is originated from the Ganges-Padma River system, a trans-boundary river between India and Bangladesh. Once the river was rich in fish biodiversity, but due to man-made and natural causes the availability of fish reduced drastically. A comprehensive analysis of fish diversity indices, gear efficiency, catch composition and decline causes of fish diversity in Gorai River, Bangladesh was accomplished. The data were collected on monthly basis from January to December 2018 from three major fishing sites of the river. A total of 62 fish and 2 prawn species under 12 orders and 24 families were recorded. Cypriniformes was the leading order consisting 27% of the total catch. The mean values of Shannon-Weaver diversity (HÃ¢â‚¬Â²), Simpson's index (1-D), Margalef's richness (d) and Pielou's evenness (JÃ¢â‚¬Â²) indices were recorded as, 1.478 Ã‚Â± 0.495, 0.57 Ã‚Â± 0.197, 15.115 Ã‚Â± 4.435 and 0.481 Ã‚Â± 0.152, respectively. At the similarity of 58.7%, two groups were attained in the cluster analysis and the Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) showed 40% similarity among the three sites in twelve months based on the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix. The highest and lowest CPUE were recorded from seine net (5.2 Ã‚Â± 1.72 kg gearÃ¢Ë†â€™1 haulÃ¢Ë†â€™1) and hook &amp; long lines (0.0135 Ã‚Â± 0.0015 kg gearÃ¢Ë†â€™1haulÃ¢Ë†â€™1), respectively whereas, highest and lowest gear efficiency were recorded from lift net (0.321 Ã‚Â± 0.036 kg gearÃ¢Ë†â€™1personÃ¢Ë†â€™1hourÃ¢Ë†â€™1) and fish trap (0.0005 Ã‚Â± 0.0002 kg gearÃ¢Ë†â€™1personÃ¢Ë†â€™1hourÃ¢Ë†â€™1), respectively. Alternatively, the highest fish catch was recorded on April (21228 Ã‚Â± 464.38 kg) and lowest on August (3855 Ã‚Â± 138.21 kg). According to the fishermen fish biodiversity of the Gorai River declined day by day due to overexploitation, destructive fishing practice, pollution, construction of obstacles for fish movement, and natural causes like siltation. Proper implementation of fish acts and regulations, use of authorized fishing gear, community-based fisheries management, sanctuary establishment and management, stocking of fish fingerling, and raising public awareness can play a great role in enhancing and conserving fish biodiversity in the Gorai River of Bangladesh.

594,Improving the management and use of water resources for small-scale irrigation farming in the Garu Tempane District of Ghana,"Small scale irrigation farming has been recognized as an important avenue for improving the well being of poor people living in arid and marginal areas of the world. The contribution of small scale irrigation can be seen in its ability to ensure food security as well as contribute to the income of farmers. In the Garu-Tempane District, small scale irrigation farming is a major source of livelihood for people in the district. Despite the importance of the irrigation schemes to dry season farming the schemes face challenges such as inadequate water, inadequate canals, choked and broken canals due to frequent breakdown and inadequate repairs which affect their effective operation. Although the major use of the dam waters was dry season farming, animal watering and fishing were also found to be significant uses of the dam waters. In north-eastern Ghana as it is in many parts of the third world, external development agencies support the formation of Water User Associations (WUAs) for the management of community-based irrigation schemes. Although, the management of the schemes and the use of the dam is the responsibility of the community represented by the WUAs it was revealed by the study that, in the management of challenges that confront small scale irrigation schemes, WUAs depended on the supportive roles of traditional authorities as well as district assemblies for discharging their management responsibilities more effectively.

595,Integrated Community Based Coastal Management: Lesson from the Field,"Coastal abrasion has been occurred throughout coastline of Java reaching 745 km at length, account for 44% of total Java's coastline. This phenomena is caused by reclamation, cutting of mangrove, land-use change and other human activities specifically at coastal area. Coastal abrasion stimulates flood or tidal flood, when sea level rise, the sea water flows to the land undated fish pond, settlement and other infrastructures standing at coastal area. Tidal flood destroys settlement lead to significant decrease of property value: land and house. Coastal abrasion caused lose people's job and income. One measure taken by local community is mangrove cultivation intended to prevent sea level rise flowing to the inland. However many efforts taken by community frequently fail because of un-integrated approach. This paper reviews a mangrove plantations in Mangunharjo, district of Tugu, Semarang, Central Java by utilizing an innovative approach integrating environmental, economic and social aspect.

596,The anatomy of primary care and mental health clinician communication: A quality improvement case study,"BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of comorbid physical and mental illnesses among veterans is well known. Therefore, ensuring effective communication between primary care (PC) and mental health (MH) clinicians in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system is essential. The VA's Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) initiative has further raised awareness of the need for communication between PC and MH. Improving such communication, however, has proven challenging. OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively understand barriers to PC-MH communication in an academic community-based clinic by using continuous quality improvement (CQI) tools and then initiate a change strategy. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND APPROACH: An interdisciplinary quality improvement (QI) work group composed of 11 on-site PC and MH providers, administrators, and researchers identified communication barriers and facilitators using fishbone diagrams and process flow maps. The work group then verified and provided context for the diagram and flow maps through medical record review (32 patients who received both PC and MH care), interviews (6 stakeholders), and reports from four previously completed focus groups. Based on these findings and a previous systematic review of interventions to improve interspecialty communication, the team initiated plans for improvement. KEY RESULTS: Key communication barriers included lack of effective standardized communication processes, practice style differences, and inadequate PC training in MH. Clinicians often accessed advice or formal consultation based on pre-existing across-discipline personal relationships. The work group identified collocated collaborative care, joint care planning, and joint case conferences as feasible, evidence-based interventions for improving communication. CONCLUSIONS: CQI tools enabled providers to systematically assess local communication barriers and facilitators and engaged stakeholders in developing possible solutions. A locally tailored CQI process focusing on communication helped initiate change strategies and ongoing improvement efforts.

597,Studying common-pool resources over time: A longitudinal case study of the Buen Hombre fishery in the Dominican Republic,"Like many small-scale fishing communities around the world, the community of Buen Hombre in the Dominican Republic is dealing with a set of challenges to reconcile its fishing activities with the ecology on which it depends. Also like many such communities, this case has been examined at a particular period in time by a group of social scientists, but not over substantial lengths of time in order to examine the longitudinal validity of the conclusions made during this period. In this paper we combine data from previous anthropological work with our own primary social and ecological data to conduct a longitudinal case study of the Buen Hombre fishery. Our over-time comparison focuses on a suite of mostly social and institutional variables to explain what we find to be a continued degradation of the fishery, and we conclude the analysis by presenting a causal-loop diagram, summarizing our inferences regarding the complex interactions among these variables. We find that a mix of factors, notably changes in gear and fishing sites used, the number of fishermen and their livelihood diversity, as well as an increased connectivity between Buen Hombre and its external environment, have contributed to the decline of the condition of Buen Hombre coral reef fishery. We conclude with a discussion of what may lie ahead for this particular case and others like it.

598,Potential effects of united states-mexico border hardening on ecological and human communities in the malpai borderlands: Diversity,"Between 17 October and 29 December 2008, contractors working for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) constructed approximately 19 km of contiguous barrier along the United States-Mexico border in the Malpai Borderlands region of southeastern Arizona. The construction was part of the U.S. Secure Fence Act of 2006, which mandated installation of fences, barriers, roads, and surveillance technology on five segments of the United States-Mexican border, totaling approximately 1120 km (or 35% of the entire border) by December 2008. To expedite implementation of the act, Congress authorized the secretary of Homeland Security to waive all or parts of 37 federal statutes pertaining to the conservation of cultural and environmental resources, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Clean Air and Clean Water acts, and the Antiquities Act. Secretary Michael Chertoff exercised this authority on 1 April 2008. According to the Associated Press (28 January 2009), 962 km of barriers had been completed as of January 2009; DHS maps indicate that nearly all of the new construction is located between San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. The Malpai Borderlands region harbors significant cultural and ecological resources and has been the site of extraordinary conservation efforts in recent decades (Curtin 2002; Sayre 2006). Cultural sites and artifacts are ubiquitous, reflecting aboriginal human use from the Clovis period to the last days of the Apaches as well as historical Euro-American settlement. Judging from natural heritage data, there are more species of plants and animals in the borderlands than in any other place of comparable size in the United States (Brown & Kodric-Brown 1996): the Malpai planning area harbors an estimated 4000 species of plants, 104 species of mammals, 327 species of birds, 136 species of reptiles and amphibians, and the greatest known richness of bee species in the world. Thirteen species are listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA, and dozens more are protected under state laws. Since 1994 the Malpai Borderlands Group (MBG), a nonprofit organization founded by area landowners, has led a community-based, collaborative effort to protect the area from exurban development, restore fire and grasslands, and conserve livestock ranching as a viable livelihood. The MBG's achievements have been heralded and supported by philanthropists, foundations, journalists, scholars, government agencies, and environmental groups across the United States (Curtin 2002). Even as the barriers were being constructed, the MBG and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service signed a habitat conservation plan (HCP), granting MBG and participating landowners a permit to take individuals of 19 listed species incidental to otherwise legal ranching- and conservation-related management practices (including prescribed fires). From start to finish, the HCP took 5 years to complete; without the waiver from Congress, the new barrier would have required a comparable planning effort. The ecological value of the Malpai Borderlands is exceptionally high due to its location at the intersection of five continental biomes, but in other respects it has much in common with most of the rest of the United States-Mexico border: pronounced biogeographic variation, relatively intact natural communities of flora and fauna, and limited human development due to both natural conditions (weather, soils, rainfall, topography) and social circumstances (remoteness, low population densities, marginal economies). Indeed, it is precisely the relative lack of human impacts that has allowed the biological and cultural resources along the border to persist in situ, and it is for this reason that hardening the border may represent a threat of such great proportions. Previously, the international border had been delineated only by widely spaced monuments erected in the 1890s and a barbed-wire fence completed in the 1940s (Fig. 1). The topography is rugged and broken, defined by high mountains and drainage networks carved by floods through erodible valley soils. Few roads accessed the area, none of which were paved. The potential effects of border hardening on biodiversity are of grave concern to conservation biologists but are uncertain at this time. The Malpai Borderlands case suggests that infrastructure installed to build border barriers poses a greater ecological threat than the barriers themselves and that the top-down manner in which construction occurred undermines the social relationships on which effective conservation in the region has been built and ultimately depends. These social effects of border hardening must be assessed in addition to ecological effects.

In order to assist with ranking these community-based proposals for available funding, the Joint Venture designed a quantitative scoring method as a decision support tool that addressed range-wide threats that were documented to limit brook charr production. These threats include habitat modification (e.g., dams, urbanization, and agricultural landuse) and interactions with antagonistic non-native species [i. e., brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)]. This article evaluated the prioritization method used by comparing the quantitative rankings of the proposals with the final reports for 12 completed projects using paired t tests for unequal sample sizes and variance. Two of the 12 comparisons revealed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between project proposals and final reports; namely, the scoring criteria for the proposals did not accurately reflect the outcome of these projects in relation to brook charr management. Large inter-quartile ranges between reviewer scores were common, indicating that the quantitative scoring method includes qualitative elements. In addition to the science-based criteria, subjective value judgments by individual reviewers have factored into the Joint Venture's decision making process. By evaluating the decision support tool, this analysis aims to assist the Joint Venture in structuring its approach to conservation and rehabilitation of brook charr populations in the eastern U. S. To better improve the Joint Venture's ability to address brook charr management on a regional level, we recommend that future proposal prioritization scoring criteria provide more explicit guidance for accurate scoring, separate scoring methods for policy and assessment work, and a weighting factor for larger than sub-watershed projects and for scoring criteria for which information is unknown.

601,Local knowledge and adult learning in environmental adult education: Community-based ecotourism in southern Thailand,"This paper examines how local knowledge is employed in environmental adult education in a community-based ecotourism project in an island community in southern Thailand. The study is based on field research and analysis of project websites, media reports and documents. Situated at the intersection of global tourism and a local Thai-Malay Muslim fishing community, the ecotourism project functions as an alternative tourism development model challenging dominant practices of mass tourism. In the project, tourists stay as guests in local homes, and learn firsthand from family and community ecotourism guides. The informal ecotourism 'curriculum' for tourists centres on local knowledge of tidal and marine ecosystems, environmental conservation efforts, local culture, and traditional livelihood activities. Tourists learn experientially to understand and appreciate this local knowledge, and in the process, contribute to the sustenance of the community, to the preservation of culture, and to the conservation of the marine resources upon which the community depends. Members of the ecotourism project, for their part, have engaged in a wide range of adult learning over the project's lifespan. This learning includes skills and knowledge in ecotourism management, environmental conservation, cross-cultural exchange and political activism. Although the advent of mass tourism on the island now threatens to overwhelm the local community, the capacity for environmental adult education, adult learning and political activism built up over many years by members of the ecotourism project will likely help to moderate, if not control, the deleterious effects of future commercial development.

602,Community-based ecosystem management (CbEM) of Arial Beel at Munshiganj District in Bangladesh by integrating MIMES model,"The purpose of this study is to assess the current state of community-based ecosystem management (CbEM) of at Munshiganj District in Bangladesh by applying Multiscale Integrated Model of Ecosystem Services (MIMES) approach. Both primary and secondary data were collected through questionnaire survey, focus group discussions (FGD) and content analysis from various sources. The SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities, and threat) analysis are applied to prioritize the most important strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in Arial Beel ecosystem services. Besides, the DPSIR framework was also applied for conceptual framework to assess the effects on ecosystem services. The study outcome reveals that all ecosystem services (ES) have high importance to the respondents in every sphere of life. The MIMES model analysis was shown that easily accessible and pleasant climatic conditions were the strength whereas funding problems and less private input on agriculture were identified to be the weakness. Fisheries utilization and the huge availability of raw materials were found to be opportunities. On the other hand, over-harvesting of the natural resources and increasing, use of fertilizer/pesticides in agricultural land were found to be the main threat for ecosystem services. Also, the DPSIR model framework gives a conceptual idea about the driving forces, its pressure, its current state, impact, and responses of the ecosystem services, respectively. Finally, this paper shows some aspects of community perception of ES which have the potentiality to generate knowledge to protect the services of the wetland.

603,"Conservation and biomonitoring in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bihar, India","From March 2001 to December 2003 eight direct count surveys in an upstream direction were conducted for Ganges river dolphins Platanista gangetica gangetica in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, a c. 60 km long segment of the middle Ganges River in Bihar, India. The mean number of dolphins recorded during upstream surveys was 119.4Ã‚Â±SD 31.8 (range 88-174), with an encounter rate of 1.8 dolphins km-1 (range 1.4-2.8). During these surveys a rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife was also documented, including the Indian smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, gharial Gavialis gangeticus, a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 water bird species. An assessment of fisheries documented 76 fish species of which 43% were caught exclusively in monofilament gill nets, a gear known to kill dolphins by entanglement. Eight new records of fishes preyed upon by Ganges river dolphins were identified from the stomach contents of two dolphin carcasses (Setipinna brevifilis, Osteobrama cotio cotio, Puntius sophore, Crosochelius latius, Mystus cavasius, Heteropneustus fossilis, Macrognathus pancalus, Sperata seenghala). These fishes and other species previously recorded in the diet of the dolphins composed 33.3% of the total catch sampled in 2001-2003. Interviews of 108 fishing households revealed that literacy rates were low (29.9%) and almost 50% earned less than USD 411 per year. The most important conservation actions that could be taken are for national and state governments to establish civil control and promote the development of community-based fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives could enjoy ownership rights to certain river segments in exchange for employing sustainable fishing techniques that are less injurious to dolphins.

604,"Community-based natural resource use and management of Bigodi Wetland Sanctuary, Uganda, for livelihood benefits","Conservation and sustainable management of wetlands requires participation of local stakeholders, including communities. The Bigodi Wetland is unusual because it is situated in a common property landscape but the local community has been running a successful community-based natural resource management programme (CBNRM) for the wetland for over a decade. Whilst external visitors to the wetland provide ecotourism revenues we sought to quantify community benefits through the use of wetland goods such as firewood, plant fibres, and the like, and costs associated with wild animals damaging farming activities. We interviewed 68 households living close to the wetland and valued their cash and non-cash incomes from farming and collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and water. The majority of households collected a wide variety of plant and fish resources and water from the wetland for household use and livestock. Overall, 53% of total household cash and non-cash income was from collected products, mostly the wetland, 28% from arable agriculture, 12% from livestock and 7% from employment and cash transfers. Female-headed households had lower incomes than male-headed ones, and with a greater reliance on NTFPs. Annual losses due to wildlife damage were estimated at 4.2% of total gross income. Most respondents felt that the wetland was important for their livelihoods, with more than 80% identifying health, education, craft materials and firewood as key benefits. Ninety-five percent felt that the wetland was in a good condition and that most residents observed the agreed CBNRM rules regarding use of the wetland. This study confirms the success of the locally run CBNRM processes underlying the significant role that the wetland plays in local livelihoods.

605,The present status of artisanal fisheries of extreme southern Brazil: An effort towards community-based management,"The continental shelf of the extreme southern Brazil is one of the most productive fishing areas in Brazil. Great part of the commercial species is related to the estuary of Patos Lagoon. The estuary serves as spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for several species. The artisanal fishery in the estuarine area exists since the end of the last century but from 1982 onwards, catches have declined sharply. Nowadays, the estuarine fishery does not exist as an economic activity, except for pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus paulensis) and mullet (Mugil platanus). The artisanal fishery involves about 3500 fishermen. Fisheries management in the Patos Lagoon and coastal area has been traditionally done in a top-down process: government decides and acts unilaterally. As a consequence, regulations exist only officially. In 1996 the Forum of Patos Lagoon, a multi-partner entity that includes political, economical and legal institutions, was established. This is the first initiative of the community to become part of the organization and regulation process of the fisheries in the area. The Forum activities initiatives range from evaluation of the present practices of fisheries management and enforcement, encouragement of co-operative and associated initiatives; to planning and development of activities that may lead to the possible recovery of the productive capacity of the Patos Lagoon. A new regulation for the area was produced considering, for the first time, the interest of the community. Although this represents a major step on fisheries management in the area, it resents the lack of a specific management for fisheries that exploit the same stocks in marine waters.

606,Lessons learnt from a collaborative management programme in coastal Tanzania,"The Tanga Coastal Zone Conservation and Development Programme, initiated in 1994, was among the first such projects to make livelihoods improvement a key objective, and to use a community-based approach. It developed an approach to coastal management planning that is broadly satisfactory to both communities and the government. Six fisheries management areas and two mangrove management areas were established. Institutional arrangements for the collaborative approach were strengthened and community leaders and local government officers were trained in a range of relevant skills. A coastal environmental education programme for primary schools involved several thousand schoolchildren, and a gender programme built the confidence of women. Implementation of the management measures was noticeably harder than planning, particularly elimination of destructive fishing methods. Fishers and coastal communities now however have a much greater involvement in, and understanding of, coastal management and consequently a greater sense of ownership. Ã‚Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

607,A report on a fisheries conflict management training workshop in Laos,"A conflict management training workshop was delivered in October 2019 in Vientiane, Laos, to fisheries practitioners. Discussions held during the workshop highlighted conflict as a key issue within community-based fisheries management and the need for fisheries staff from various sectors, and the communities they work with, to have an understanding of conflict management concepts and related skills. Key themes of the discussions of fisheries conflict in Laos were related to property rights, lack of adherence of fishers to regulations, funding for local community activities and weak governance structures. The key learnings of the training workshop are that fisheries practitioners are dealing with social conflict in their work activities and need support in managing these conflicts, as for many fisheries professionals this work is outside their main area of expertise. There is a role for further research into fisheries conflict in Laos to provide context-specific insight, but this must be accompanied by appropriate knowledge exchange to allow practitioners to make use of these insights for real-world conflict management activities.

608,How seasonal fish biodiversity is impacting local river fisheries and fishers socioeconomic condition: A case study in bangladesh,"River fisheries are critical to ensure the sustainable provision of quality food and nutrition as well as economic stability of the millions of local populations in developing nations. The Fakirni River is home to a diversity of fish species. Here, we present the status and seasonal abundance of fish species in the Fakirni River and their impact on the fishermen's livelihood compared to other small rivers in Bangladesh. Monthly sampling was carried out using a lift net, and a total of 26 fish species belonging to 18 genera, ten families, and six orders were recorded during 12 months. The Shannon-Weiner diversity, species richness, evenness index, dominance, Simpson index, Brillouin index, equitability, and Berger-Parker indices provided 1.61Ã‚Â±0.47, 1.93Ã‚Â±0.53, 0.52Ã‚Â±0.41, 0.29Ã‚Â±0.17, 0.70Ã‚Â±0.17, 1.47Ã‚Â±0.41, 0.68Ã‚Â±0.17, and 0.42Ã‚Â±0.18, respectively. The Bray-Curtis similarity cluster analysis was performed among the diversity indices and observed three available fish species. Almost all the fishermen (91%) were Muslim of age 38.67Ã‚Â±15.05 years and possessed fishing experience for 19.94Ã‚Â±15.42 years, with a monthly income of BDT 4166.67Ã‚Â±1331.85. The fishermen community neither received any training nor involvement with the NGOs or other organizations to get any financial support or loans. In conclusion, despite significantly vulnerable contexts of the community-based fisheries management system and inadequate resources, fishing's livelihood outcomes were positive.

610,"Locally managed marine areas: Implications for socio-economic impacts in Kadavu, Fiji","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a widely used marine conservation tool designed to preserve marine biodiversity and improve fisheries management. Although the environmental benefits of MPAs are well established, evaluating the social and economic impacts of MPAs is challenging. In this paper we quantitatively identify the economic and social differences between communities based on whether or not the community has a tabu area in their local fishing ground. This is an area permanently closed to fishing within a locally managed marine area (LMMA), a form of MPA in the Pacific region. To do this we analyse survey data at both the household and village level in Kadavu, an administrative province of Fiji. We find there are differences in economic activity and diet between the communities but little difference in overall income and wealth. Our study shows that villages with an active tabu area have more positive social outcomes in terms of perceptions of LMMAs. However, there are some notable negative social outcomes as well. In particular, we find that households not engaged in commercial fishing perceive conflict around the management of marine resources. We also find that households engaged in commercial fishing believe penalties for violating LMMA rules are high. Together, these results could potentially impede the adoption of LMMAs and tabu areas. Overall, our survey results do not indicate that tabu areas are detrimental or beneficial on the whole, either economically and socially.

With the prevalence of a local marine tenure systems and the widespread decline of coastal resources, communities need to be part of the solution to facilitate recovery. A novel marine monitoring toolkit was developed in Vanuatu with the participation of community resource monitors to inform local management actions. The Toolkit includes simplified versions of established monitoring methods for marine habitats and resources to achieve a balance between robust science and methods appropriate for communities. Key to its success is that it was developed in response to community needs using a participatory approach and implemented through a series of training workshops with local environmental leaders. Of particular note, the Toolkit includes a standardised process for communities to use monitoring results instantly, without the need for complex data analyses or external support. Using the Toolkit, communities are able to adapt their traditional management to address immediate and medium-term issues in their local marine environment. The observed benefits of the Toolkit include increased local awareness through community-led environmental outreach, increased ownership of and motivation for local monitoring and management, implementation of local management actions, expansion of traditional marine managed areas, and new local ecotourism initiatives to generate revenue to support environmental stewardship.

This paper focuses on household responses to AIDS related stressors and utilization of natural resources by communities involved in Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) projects in Ngamiland, in north western Botswana. The study involved two single village and two multi-village community trusts. Data were collected through a simple random sampling of 121 households obtained from the 2001 national population census enumeration areas. The results showed that households in CBNRM villages have diverse sources of livelihoods such as farming; basket making and government assistance, sale of grass and reeds, fishing and remittances. More than half of sampled households had orphans, 68 had a continuously ill person (CIP) in the last five years, and, of these, 63 had died within the past year. Affected households received support primarily from the extended family, neighbours, church groups and friends.

613,Developing policy-relevant river fish monitoring in Greece: Insights from a nationwide survey,"A wide-ranging river fish survey was executed in the summer of 2009 as part of the preparatory actions for the establishment of a monitoring programme for the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). This was the first extensive electrofishing campaign for WFD standardised bioassessment in Greece and the experience and insights gained are used here to provide a review of fish-based assessment conditions and requirements in this country. The survey sampled 85 sites on 25 rivers throughout mainland Greece, collecting 70 species of freshwater fish. Quantitative site-based assemblage data is used for taxonomic and ordination analyses revealing a strong biogeographic regionalisation in the distribution of the ichthyofauna. The structural and spatial organisation of the fish fauna using species-level and community-level data analyses is explored in three ecoregions where data was deemed sufficient. Transitions in community taxonomic composition among ecoregions were abrupt and concordant with geographical barriers, reflecting the influence of historical biogeographic processes. Community-based analysis revealed a substantial degree of variation in quantitative attributes of the fish assemblages among ecoregions. Key conclusions of this work are: (a) the fish-based bioassessment system must be regionalised to reflect biogeographic variation; (b) high faunal heterogeneity among ecoregions (taxonomic, structural), and to a lower degree among basins, constrains the transferability of bioassessment metrics and indices created for explicit regions to other regional frameworks; (c) faunal depauperation in most of the study areas reduces the utility of functional bioassessment metrics and also limits the utilisation of rare species and the applicability of the classical form of the ""Index of Biotic Integrity"" concept.

614,"Management histories of Sumilon and Apo Marine Reserves, Philippines, and their influence on national marine resource policy","The histories of management of the Sumilon and Apo marine reserves in the Philippines provide a stark contrast. Both began with marine conservation and education programs at the community level, initiated by the Marine Laboratory of Silliman University in 1973 at Sumilon, and in 1976 at Apo. At both islands community support for the 'no take' reserve concept evolved gradually, via perceived benefits of increased local fish yields and income from tourism. However, Sumilon reserve has been fished down twice (in 1984,1992), and was still being fished in December 1998. Apo reserve has been protected from fishing successfully for 16 y (1982-1998). The management histories of these two marine reserves are the longest and most detailed available for coral reefs. Scientific data spanning 1976-1993 for Sumilon and 1980-1993 for Apo have provided some of the best available evidence of the utility of such reserves as management tools in coral reef fisheries. At Sumilon, collapse of reserve protection in 1984, after 9.5 y of restrictions on fishing, led to significant declines in reef fisheries yields in areas adjacent to the reserve. At Apo, continuous protection from 1982 to 1993 has led to consistent build up of fish in the reserve and some evidence that local fish yields have increased. The unique time series of scientific data obtained from Sumilon and Apo islands are the result of their distinct management histories. The greater success of management at Apo was due to community support for the reserve concept being actively maintained for the past 16 y. Socio-political factors caused the level of community support for the Sumilon reserve to wax and wane over this period. Both case histories have had a profound effect on marine resource management in the Philippines. As marine reserve models they had substantial influence on the design of the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS). Policy now encourages co-management between the National government and local communities, with a strong emphasis on decentralization of decision making and recognition of local territorial use rights in fisheries.",NA,No,"The paper's case study is based in the Philippines, not in any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is focused on marine reserves in the Philippines, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

615,Fixing marine governance in Fiji? The new scalar narrative of ecosystem-based management,"Although there is widespread concern over degrading marine environments, there is debate within the global marine conservation agenda about the nature of the problem and appropriate solutions. At the center of this debate lie questions about the appropriate scale at which to plan and implement marine resource management. In the late 1990s, Fiji became recognized as one of the most successful examples of community-based marine resource management in the world. Recently, there has been a move to manage human-environment interactions at larger ""natural"" scales. We draw from the political ecology and ""politics of scale"" literatures, and a critical realist understanding of nature and politics, to explain the emergence of large-scale management and conservation in Fiji. We contribute to a ""political ecology of scale"" by developing the concept of a scalar narrative to show how social and ecological scales are reworked in the development of an ecosystem-based approach to marine management in Fiji. In doing so, we consider implications of the struggle to define the appropriate scale of marine management, which is closely bound to debates about the role of science and local participation. Our findings suggest that the struggle to define the scale at which marine management should be planned and implemented is inseparable from the struggle over who should define, inform, and conduct the governance process. We aim to clarify marine policy debates as policy actors worldwide move forward to implement ecosystem-based management, increase marine protected area coverage, and pursue sustainable development.

Methodology: It was carried out following the model for assessing the sustainability of fishing communities in tourist destinations, described by Faxina (2014). The questionnaire was chosen as a data collection instrument where 64 representatives out of 75 families in the community were interviewed. Originality/Relevance: The current work exhibits an environmental sustainability assessment tool for communities, which reduces the scale of analysis and allows to know the specific needs of small population groups. Results: The community has reached a medium level of environmental sustainability, and the data reveal a lack of means of accessing information, public transportation and community organization. In addition, low diversity of job opportunities, lack of professional training, weaknesses in the collection and disposal of waste, and uneven distribution of water and energy were observed. Theoretical/methodological contributions: The importance of small-scale sustainability assessment models was noticed, which can be useful resources for monitoring the development process, especially in cases where there is a new productive activity underway, which has the potential to cause negative environmental impacts unknown to the community. Social/management contributions: The environmental sustainability assessment can be used as a planning and management tool in different instances of governance, especially by community leaders, encouraging empowerment and local participation, principles supported by Community-Based Tourism.

617,FishNET: An automated relational database for zebrafish colony management,"The zebrafish Danio rerio is a powerful model system to study the genetics of development and disease. However, maintenance of zebrafish husbandry records is both time intensive and laborious, and a standardized way to manage and track the large amount of unique lines in a given laboratory or centralized facility has not been embraced by the field. Here, we present FishNET, an intuitive, open-source, relational database for managing data and information related to zebrafish husbandry and maintenance. By creating a Ã¢â‚¬Å“virtual facility,Ã¢â‚¬Â FishNET enables users to remotely inspect the rooms, racks, tanks, and lines within a given facility. Importantly, FishNET scales from one laboratory to an entire facility with several laboratories to multiple facilities, generating a cohesive laboratory and community-based platform. Automated data entry eliminates confusion regarding line nomenclature and streamlines maintenance of individual lines, while flexible query forms allow researchers to retrieve database records based on user-defined criteria. FishNET also links associated embryonic and adult biological samples with data, such as genotyping results or confocal images, to enable robust and efficient colony management and storage of laboratory information. A shared calendar function with email notifications and automated reminders for line turnover, automated tank counts, and census reports promote communication with both end users and administrators. The expected benefits of FishNET are improved vivaria efficiency, increased quality control for experimental numbers, and flexible data reporting and retrieval. FishNETÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy, intuitive record management and open-source, end-userÃ¢â‚¬â€œmodifiable architecture provides an efficient solution to real-time zebrafish colony management for users throughout a facility and institution and, in some cases, across entire research hubs.

618,Impacts and importance of introduction of culture-based fisheries in three medium sized perennial reservoirs in Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka is endowed with a large number (>12,000) of irrigation reservoirs, which are primarily used for irrigation. Culture-based fisheries in perennial reservoirs are a recent development in Sri Lanka. The government of Sri Lanka has recognised culture-based fisheries as an effective way to increase fish supplies in rural areas at affordable prices, providing livelihood opportunities, strengthening rural economy and thereby contributing towards poverty alleviation. In this paper, the impact of the introduction of culture-based fisheries into three reservoirs, namely Amparawewa, Hambegamuwa and Aluthdiulwewa, is assessed. Introduction of culture-based fisheries resulted in significant increases in fish production in all three reservoirs. Stocking of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus 1758), catla Catla catla (Hamilton 1822), rohu Labeo rohita (Hamilton 1822), mrigal Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton 1822) and freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man 1879) in these reservoirs resulted in positive monetary gains. Culture-based fisheries provided livelihoods for 55, 77 and 37 villagers in Amparawewa, Hambegamuwa and Aluthdiulwewa, respectively. Gross income generated from culture-based fisheries in these three reservoirs was 88.9 %, 68.1 % and 50.6 % of that of downstream paddy cultivation. Profits earned through culture-based fisheries in the three reservoirs were 133.2 %, 129.4 % and 86.3 % respectively of that of downstream paddy cultivation. Introduction of CBF in these three reservoirs resulted in increased availability of fish in rural areas, enhanced food security, more livelihood opportunities and strengthening of the rural economy.

620,Importance of deepening integration of crime and conservation sciences,"Conservation crime is a globally distributed societal problem. Conservation crime science, an emerging interdisciplinary field, has the potential to help address this problem. However, its utility depends on serious reflection on the transposition of crime science approaches to conservation contexts, which may differ in meaningful ways from traditional crime contexts. We considered the breadth of crime science approaches being used in conservation as well as the depth of crime science integration in conservation. We used the case of sea cucumber (Holothuria floridana, Isostichopus badionotus) trafficking in Mexico as an example of why the interdisciplinarity of crime and conservation sciences should be deepened and how integration can help ideate new solutions. We first conducted a review of literature to capture the range of interdisciplinarity applications. We identified 6 crime science approaches being applied to the conservation contexts of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; wildlife and plant crime; and illegal logging. We then compared this knowledge base to the case of illegal sea cucumber fishing in Mexico. We identified 5 challenges in the application of these approaches to conservation contexts: the relative diffusion of harms and victims in conservation crimes; scalar mismatches in crime, authority, and the conservation issue itself; interactions between legal and illegal networks; communities and their authority to define and control crime; and the role of natural science in the rule of law. Considering these 5 factors may enhance the depth of interdisciplinarity between crime and conservation sciences. Nurturing interdisciplinary crime and conservation science will expand innovation and help accelerate successful risk management programs and other policy agendas. Ã‚Â© 2021 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to assess the aetiology, practice patterns and disease burden and growth of ESKD in the region comparing the economies. Methods: The national nephrology societies of the region; responded to the questionnaire; based on latest registries, acceptable community-based studies and society perceptions. The countries in the region were classified into Group 1 (High|higher-middle-income) and Group 2 (lower|lowermiddle income). Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparison. Results: Fifteen countries provided the data. The average incidence of ESKD was estimated at 226.7 per million population (pmp), (Group 1 vs. Group 2, 305.8 vs. 167.8 pmp) and average prevalence at 940.8 pmp (Group 1 vs. Group 2, 1306 vs. 321 pmp). Group 1 countries had a higher incidence and prevalence of ESKD. Diabetes, hypertension and chronic glomerulonephritis were most common causes. The mean age in Group 2 was lower by a decade (Group 1 vs. Group 2Ã¢â‚¬â€59.45 vs 47.7 years). Conclusion: Haemodialysis was the most common kidney replacement therapy in both groups and conservative management of ESKD was the second commonest available treatment option within Group 2.

622,Two sides of a coin: Effects of climate change on the native and non-native distribution of Colossoma macropomum in South America,"Climate change and species invasions interact in nature, disrupting biological communities. Based on this knowledge, we simultaneously assessed the effects of climate change on the native distribution of the Amazonian fish Colossoma macropomum as well as on its invasiveness across river basins of South America, using ecological niche modeling. We used six niche models within the ensemble forecast context to predict the geographical distribution of C. macropomum for the present time, 2050 and 2080. Given that this species has been continuously introduced into non-native South American basins by fish farming activities, we added the locations of C. macropomum farms into the modeling process to obtain a more realistic scenario of its invasive potential. Based on modelling outputs we mapped climate refuge areas at different times. Our results showed that a plenty of climatically suitable areas for the occurrence of C. macropomum occurrence are located outside the original basins at the present time and that its invasive potential is greatly amplified by fish farms. Simulations of future geographic ranges revealed drastic range contraction in the native region, implying concerns not only with respect to the species conservation but also from a socio-economic perspective since the species is a cornerstone of artisanal and commercial fisheries in the Amazon. Although the invasive potential is projected to decrease in the face of climate change, climate refugia will concentrate in ParanÃƒÂ¡ River, Southeast Atlantic and East Atlantic basins, putting intense, negative pressures on the native fish fauna these regions. Our findings show that short and long-term management actions are required for: i) the conservation of natural stocks of C. macropomum in the Amazon, and ii) protecting native fish fauna in the climate refuges of the invaded regions.

623,Integrating biological conservation into management: Community adaptive learning in the wetlands of bangladesh,"Wetlands in Bangladesh represent complex, dynamic natural environments rich in biological diversity and providing a range of ecosystem services to local people. Capture fisheries are a direct link between biodiversity and the poor, but have been declining from overexploitation and wetland degradation. Since 2007 a network of 250 community based organisations (CBOs) across the country has shown a growing interest in managing wetlands for the benefit of poor people, motivated to use their local knowledge and capabilities in collective action to manage wetland resources in ways that conserve biodiversity. Adaptive learning between CBOs has spread good practices to sustain biodiversity and thereby the livelihoods of the poor dependent on fish and other aquatic resources. By now, 59% of CBOs have created small fish sanctuaries, 10% have re-introduced scarce fish, a third of CBOs have banned hunting and a few have added a supplementary income from tourism. By developing and sharing their own knowledge of local ecosystem dynamics and related good practices, tangible ecological and developmental benefits have been derived, increasing the well-being of local people. In 91% of sites local people consider the CBO has improved access of the poor to natural resources. In many cases the main threats faced by CBOs have come from external factors: attempts by the powerful to take control of fisheries away from CBOs; pressure to pay government to lease waterbodies; and uncoordinated and unregulated development that blocks fish movement, drains and pollutes wetlands. As such, these are challenges of governance rather than management. The needs of the poor are represented by the CBOs (64% of members are poor, and almost all CBOs consult with the poor in decision making). By networking together, the CBOs are empowered to actively address these challenges and influence policy and practice to address conservation and poverty issues.

624,"Managing the discourse of resource management: The case of sasi from 'Southeast' Maluku, Indonesia","Co-management of protected areas and renewable resources, with its focus upon local community involvement, is often proposed as some form of 'magic cure' for environmental ailments and social injustices. Notwithstanding the inherent romanticism of some of the proponents of management from 'the bottom up', there is a strong tendency to view this approach in overly utilitarian, ahistorical and often essentialist terms. In the process, the cultural, historical and political specificities and effects of this discourse are either neutralised or totally disregarded. While a number of authors have identified some of the limitations and problems associated with the implementation of community-based, co-management programmes, there is still a general reluctance to question the logic which informs and is constitutive of this discourse. In this paper, I explore the discourse of resource management in relation to the varied practices and perceptions associated with and identified as sasi. This discussion of sasi focuses upon the island of Luang, and the 1800 or so people who inhabit this island located in the southern waters of the Banda sea. The environmental and economic circumstances of Luang make it an ideal context for the investigation of 'community-based, marine resource management' strategies. However, while this context seems to comply with some of the truths produced by the discourse of resource management, in this paper I argue that the very canons of this discourse are placed at risk through people's enactment of their own projects and the expression of their own representations.",NA,No,"The case study is based in Southeast Maluku, Indonesia, not in any of the countries listed in the screening criteria."," No; The paper focuses on a case study from Southeast Maluku, Indonesia, which is not one of the specified locations in the screening criteria.

626,Spatial and temporal patterns of plant communities near small mountain streams in managed forests,"Riparian plant communities along small streams occupy a small proportion of the total landscape but can provide disproportionally large ecological, social, and economic benefits. We examined plant communities at 25 study sites along small fish-bearing streams in temperate managed forests of the Pacific Northwest spatially as a function of distance from stream and temporally by assessing a chronosequence of stand ages: young (31-51 years), mature (52-70 years), and old (>100 years). We identified three distinct vegetation communities based on species cover and richness in shrub and herb layers: riparian (0-9 m), transitional (10-29 m), and upslope (30-80 m); 12 species were indicators of these vegetation communities. For tree species, basal area increased with stand age. Shrub species cover and richness were greatest in old stands, but herb species richness was highest in young stands. Composition varied with stand age; 15 species were indicators of these differences in composition. These results, together with information on successional and wetland status, suggest that plant communities on small fish-bearing streams reflect geomorphic and fluvial settings but also follow successional patterns found in natural forests. These stands will become some of the primary unharvested, older forests within the managed forest landscape and provide insights for effective riparian management on sites impacted by historical management practices prior to the regulations requiring riparian buffers.",NA,No,"The study is conducted in the Pacific Northwest, not in any of the specified countries."," No; The abstract mentions the study is conducted in the Pacific Northwest, not in any of the listed countries.

627,Perceptions of fishermen towards marine protected areas in Cambodia and the Philippines,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be used to conserve parts of marine ecosystems, including fish stocks exploited by fisheries. Social acceptance of MPAs must be achieved if they are to function as effective management tools. Artisanal fishers operating around tropical coral reef areas were questioned in an attempt to investigate their acceptance and perceptions of MPAs. Fishers from two areas were surveyed: Koh Rong Island, Cambodia, where MPAs are a new concept to fishers, and Southern Leyte, the Philippines, where MPAs have been used in management for over 10 years. Fishers' opinions of MPAs from each study site were compared and variables affecting fishers' opinions of MPAs were also investigated at each site. Although small sample sizes of fishers were observed at each study site, results showed that the majority of fishers at each site accepted MPAs as a management tool. Cambodian fishers felt the state of marine resources had worsened in the past decade (with regards to the number of fish, the size of fish and the number of species present in their catch), whereas most Filipino fishers had noticed an opposite trend. Older Cambodian fishers had greater acceptance of MPAs; age did not affect Filipino fishers' acceptance, and did not affect any other opinions fishers had of MPAs at either site. Community-based management of MPAs was fishers' preference at both sites. The study shows evidence of MPA support in Cambodia, with mobile gear users being more willing to be involved in MPA management. Most Filipino fishers felt that their MPA improved their catches, although there was evidence of conflict between fishers since the MPA was implemented. Ã‚Â© 2012 The Author 2012.

628,Invasive Spartina alterniflora habitat forms high energy fluxes but low food web stability compared to adjacent native vegetated habitats,"Invasive Spartina spp. mostly colonizes a bare tidal flat and then establishes a new vegetated habitat, where it promotes the productivity of local ecosystems. However, it was unclear whether the invasive habitat could well exhibit ecosystem functioning, e.g. how its high productivity propagates throughout the food web and whether it thereby develops a high food web stability relative to native vegetated habitats. By developing quantitative food webs for a long-established invasive Spartina alterniflora habitat and adjacent native salt marsh (Suaeda salsa) and seagrass (Zostera japonica) habitats in China's Yellow River Delta, we investigated the distributions of energy fluxes, assessed the stability of food webs, and investigated the net trophic effects between trophic groups by combining all direct and indirect trophic interactions. Results showed that the total energy flux in the invasive S. alterniflora habitat was comparable to that in the Z. japonica habitat, whereas 4.5 times higher than that in the S. salsa habitat. While, the invasive habitat had the lowest trophic transfer efficiencies. Food web stability in the invasive habitat was about 3 and 40 times lower than that in the S. salsa and Z. japonica habitats, respectively. Additionally, there were strong net effects caused by intermediate invertebrate species in the invasive habitat rather than by fish species in both native habitats. This study revealed the contradiction between the promotion of energy fluxes and the decrease of food web stability resulting from the invasion of S. alterniflora, which provides new insights into the community-based management of plant invasions.

Therefore, they fit well within the context of community-based fisheries/co-management programmes. Fish sanctuaries are almost always established in deep-water pools, which serve as important dry season refuges for fish. The best-known fish sanctuaries in Laos are known as Fish Conservation Zones (FCZs), and are found in the mainstream Mekong River in Khong district, Champasak province, southern Laos. In Khong, there is increasing evidence that FCZs established by villagers, but with government support, are important places of concentration for various fish species. FCZs can benefit fish stocks, especially relatively sedentary species, but also highly migratory ones.

630,Linking livelihood and biodiversity conservation in protected areas: Community based tourism development perspective from developing country,"Balancing biodiversity conservation and community livelihoods is a major challenge for sustainable management of protected areas (PAs) in developing countries. Researchers and practitioners are looking at ways to resolve this challenge by connecting the livelihoods of people living near protected areas with conservation efforts. This study aims to assess community-based tourism development as a tool to link local livelihoods and biodiversity conservation in protected areas in developing county context. The study employs a mixed research approach with a descriptive research design. Structured questionnaires, focus group discussions and key informant interviews are used to collect data from local communities residing inside and adjacent areas of Nech Sar National Park in Ethiopia. The results reveal that the local communities around the national park are exposed to various shocks and vulnerability contexts such as poverty, food insecurity, and resource use conflict. Consumptive resource usage, recurring fire catastrophes, agricultural encroachment, and illegal fishing are all threatening the parkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biodiversity conservation efforts. Despite the impact of tourism on their livelihoods is marginal, local grassroots have a positive attitude towards the development of community-based tourism.

631,Enhancing community empowerment through participatory fisheries research,"This paper reports on the outcomes of a project that engaged researchers and fishers together in adapting participatory social science approaches to the purposes and the constraints of community-based fisher organizations. The work was carried out in the Scotia-Fundy Region of Atlantic Canada (the Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf) between 1999 and 2003. After a period of reflection on what was collectively learned from our experiences in this project, the academics went back to the community partners in a recent workshop for further discussion and refinement of the lessons. We conclude that true participatory fishery research, utilized in support of community-based management, can be a particularly powerful tool. However, it has few effective shortcuts, it must deal early in the research process with power imbalances, and it should involve significant political engagement and empowerment through co-learning. This assessment of participatory research in coastal fisheries also has significant implications for how we think of social capital and on how we may develop community-based resource management for a sustainable future.

632,Human migration and marine protected areas: Insights from Vezo fishers in Madagascar,"Human migration may negatively impact biodiversity and is expected to increase in future, yet the phenomenon remains poorly understood by conservation managers. We conducted a mixed-methods investigation of a contemporary migration of traditional fishers in western Madagascar, a country which has been expanding its protected area system through the establishment of both strict and multiple-use sites, and critically evaluate different models of marine protected area in light of our findings. Interviews with fishers in major destination areas revealed that most migrants come from southwest Madagascar, use non-motorised vessels, and principally target sharks and sea cucumbers. Drivers of the migration include both push and pull factors (i.e. declining resource availability in areas of origin and the continued availability of lucrative resources for export to China). Traditional fisher migrants cause limited social conflict with residents and a number of environmental problems in destination areas: however artisanal fishers with motorised vessels probably represent a greater threat to marine resources than migrants, due to their greater harvesting capacity. We suggest that multiple-use arrangements may be more appropriate than strict protected areas in both source and destination areas, because they integrate the interests of migrants rather than marginalising them: however seascape-scale management provides the best approach for managing the threats and opportunities provided by the migration at the appropriate scale.

633,The Political Economy of Marine Stewardship Council Certification: Processors and Access in Newfoundland and Labrador's Inshore Shrimp Industry,"In August 2008, the Northern shrimp, a prey of the iconic cod, became the first species managed by the Canadian government to meet the Marine Stewardship Council's (MSC) standard for 'sustainable and well-managed' fisheries. Using the Northern shrimp fishery as a case study, this paper argues that rather than being simply a tool for sustainability or even earning market access, MSC certification allows fishery 'clients'- those organizations that ultimately hold the MSC certificate - to control resource access and production relations. The processing association that acted as the initial client in this fishery gained new members by sharing access to certification in 2009 and expelled a community-based fishing co-operative from the client group in 2010. Certification dynamics in this case reflected, and were used to reinforce, a highly competitive political economy of production. These dynamics may have implications for future resource access, since shrimp stocks appear to be declining in key areas after three decades of growth.

634,Changes in social orientation: Threats to a cultural institution in marine resource exploitation in Tonga,"While access to marine resources is de jure open in Tonga, this has not led to a decline of resources and an increase in noncooperative stratregies. This is partly due to a strong social orientation underlying core values and institutions as well as economic decisions. Food sharing is one institution that strengthens social cohesion and supports sustainable strategies. Yet this social-environmental relationship is increasingly threatened by a tendency to individualize efforts and yields and thus diminish social cohesion. Extracting institutions can trigger increased efforts, and new ideologies focusing on the nuclear family trigger reduced sharing. Contrasting two island villages from Ha'apai illustrates this tendency and its consequences: weakening the social net goes together with more commercially oriented strategies. Responses occur on several levels and entail risks. On the family level, networks expand to become less dependent on marine resources, but risk eroding local social ties. On a political level, community-based management is now proposed. It remains unclear, however, in what direction these changes will lead on the community level. They may (re-)motivate single fishermen to sustain common interests, but these common interests may not be in sustaining fish stocks.

635,Tracing innovation pathways behind fisheries co-management in Vanuatu,"Co-management approaches have become a core part of coastal fisheries policy and planning practice in Vanuatu. With a long history of supporting community based fisheries management (CBFM), we trace its evolution in Vanuatu to understand how new structures and processes become adopted at scale. A theory of scaling for CBFM guides the analysis of regime shifts over time. We discuss planning for sustained spread under a national programme by categorising multiple drivers of change through three intervention pathways focussed, respectively, on developing (i) an enabling environment, (ii) institutional and individual capacity, and (iii) focussed innovative action in smaller targeted constituencies. Whilst we argue that local fisheries co-management institutions balance competing interests, and so differ amongst places, we also recognise the importance of connectivity and continuity. The realisation of a national programme therefore requires patchworks of siloed projects to be knitted together into coordinated programmatic approaches that strategically integrate activities.

636,Characterizing information on best practice guidelines for catch-and-release in websites of angling-based non-government organizations in the United States,"Recreational catch-and-release angling is an important tool for managing fish stocks. As recreational fishing is often a culturally or community-based activity, many anglers look to local grassroots and other non-government organizations (NGOs) as a source of information regarding their angling practices. For this study we examined the websites of recreational angling NGOs for mention of conservation and availability of best practice guidelines for catch-and-release fishing. Based on combinations of twelve search terms used on the Google search engine between October 2014 and March 2015, we reviewed 183 NGO websites and evaluated the language used in mission statements and website content for mention of conservation, catch-and-release, and any details related to the handling of caught fish. Any posted guidelines for catch-and-release were compared against scientifically evaluated best practices. During the time of our survey, results showed that <9% of recreational fishing NGOs mentioned catch-and-release anywhere within their websites and almost none provided complete, accurate best practice guidelines. For the small number of websites that did mention or promote guidelines for catch-and-release, there was no difference in the frequency of best practices listed among NGOs that focused on fly fishing, conventional gear fishing, or both. NGOs with a large membership shared more best practice guidelines for catch-and-release on their websites. Whether voluntary or mandatory through regulations, if catch-and-release is to be a valuable tool for conservation, our results suggest that there is a need for greater emphasis on encouraging best practices guidelines to be shared across a broad range of angling based NGOs. Knowledge sharing among angling based NGOs could be an effective way to promote best practices guidelines that ultimately help support the sustainability of recreational fisheries.

637,"The challenges and rewards of community-based coastal resources management San Salvador Island, Philippines","The residents of San Salvador Island, off the coast of Masinloc, Zambales, in the Philippines, face challenges typical of fishing communities in the Philippines. Lack of awareness and poverty have encouraged fishers to use unsound fishing methods such as explosives, sodium cyanide, and fine-mesh nets. Swidden upland agriculture and logging has resulted in the deforestation of much of the nearby Zambales Mountains, which contributes to the siltation of San Salvador's coral reefs. These factors have resulted in declining fish yields from the island's coral reefs beginning in the early 1980s, according to local fishers. Ã‚Â© 2003 State University of New York.

638,Ecosystem service approach for community-based management towards sustainable blue economy,"The present study was undertaken to examine the role of community-based fishers in blue economy taking ecosystem and livelihood development and sustainability of Gulf of Mannar, Tamil Nadu, India. A questionnaire was designed to capture context-specific community-based blue economy practices. The virtual factors and environmental determinants which affect the sustainability of ecosystem between resource benefitters were evaluated. A significant difference is noticed between male and female beneficiaries for preference to all the variables except enhanced waste management practices variable (insignificant difference- 0.183; Mann-Whitney U test). All the variables significantly advance the livelihood sustainability of ecosystem-dependent population and the ecosystem service evaluation process. The present survey also resulted that the better sustainability of blue economy involved the significant implementation of growth agendas by minimizing the effluent and sewage disposal, developmental activities in industrial areas, disaster outbreak and eliminating harmful fishing practices, overfishing and instead incentivizing approaches that promote growth, improve conservation, build sustainable fisheries, and terminate the IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing. An ecosystem-based management framework, improved governance is required to grow and improve the sustainability of livelihood and ecosystem towards a blue economy. Innovative financing to direct investments into economic activities is also needed to enhance ocean health. A further step would be to assess how such human inputs or improved management practices could be included in the set of ecosystem service indicators.

639,Individual and village-level effects on community support for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the Philippines,"A crucial factor in the success of protected areas and conservation efforts in general is the support amongst the adjacent community. It is thought to be especially crucial for the success of small MPAs. Whilst the importance of community support has been highlighted in a number of studies, it has not yet been clearly defined or explicitly studied. Questionnaires were carried out (. N=166) at three different villages within the Visayas region of the Philippines to determine individuals[U+05F3] support towards adjacent MPAs and individual characteristics that have previously been hypothesised to influence support. Multiple regressions analysis determined: (1) Which individual-level factors predict attitude towards MPAs, (2) whether attitudes of individuals are related to actions that benefit the adjacent MPA and (3) whether individual or community-level factors are better predictors of individual support for local community-based MPAs. Knowledge of MPA objectives, perceived participation in decision making, trust towards other fishers and differences between villages all significantly predicted attitudes towards MPAs. Weak relationships were found between attitudes and certain MPA related actions due to contextual factors. Village was not the only significant predictor of both attitudes and MPA related actions; individual characteristics irrespective of differences between villages, were also important in predicting support for the MPA. This study highlights the importance in distinguishing between attitudes and actions of individuals and suggests specific individual characteristics can be vital in influencing support towards MPAs.

640,"Linking coastal community livelihoods to marine conservation in Aceh, Indonesia","Abstract Many tropical biodiversity projects seek to combine development and conservation goals. Here, we assess the performance of a revolving fund, established by Fauna & Flora International (FFI), in delivering sustainable and equitable benefits to coastal community livelihood groups and individuals while ensuring that it did no apparent harm to the environment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 103 loan recipients to determine changes in attitude, perception and behaviour. After a 9 month preparation phase the project succeeded in changing a community view towards the fund from being overwhelmingly pessimistic to overwhelmingly optimistic and then loaned IDR 602,977,400 (USD 66,261), with near perfect repayment rates thereafter (indicating financial sustainability). Most (92%) respondents thought that the fund had been a success, mainly (56%) because it had increased their perceived daily income. Even though most (59%) of the loan recipients met with FFI staff at least once per month on average during the project, the linkages between conservation and development were only understood by some (40%). Nevertheless, understanding was highest amongst the project's main target group, fishermen. Furthermore, nearly half of all respondents said they now acted if they found people fishing with spear guns or throwing litter into the sea (a violation of customary law), indicating a positive change in behaviour. Although this study cannot unambiguously demonstrate that this change was purely due to the fund, as FFI was conducting other conservation activities, it helped to develop a strong relationship with the community and create an enabling environment for implementing this broader set of activities.

641,Moving mussels offshore? Perceptions of offshore aquaculture policy and expansion in New England,"Efforts to expand marine aquaculture into offshore environments have increased in the United States, however many questions remain about whether offshore aquaculture is a feasible and appropriate activity. This paper explores these questions by investigating stakeholder perceptions of offshore mussel aquaculture in New England, USA. These views provide insight into the important challenges and opportunities facing expansion, and elucidate whether and how industry may develop and be incorporated into ocean planning and management. Results shows that regulatory and financial conditions are considered the primary challenges facing offshore expansion, whereas technical, environmental, and market conditions were generally deemed favorable or manageable. There is greater uncertainty about social and political conditions. While moving mussel aquaculture offshore lessens the conflicts associated with inshore activity, it also moves industry into new spaces with unfamiliar users. There are tensions inherent in addressing these challenges. Whereas broad regulatory change will encourage offshore development, targeted government involvement may be more productive in the near term. Similarly, while large seafood companies may appear viable candidates for offshore development, they are also limited by regulatory, social, and political resistance. Overall, an increased emphasis on government interventions at the local and regional scale are desirable for proponents of offshore expansion. The paper discusses the management implications of these findings, and suggests that a shift in focus toward targeted and non-regulatory government interventions; local, regional, and informal planning discussions; and community-based and cooperative mussel aquaculture initiatives may hold promise for responsible development in New England offshore waters and elsewhere.

643,Wildlife resource policy issues in the west,"Wildlife policy in the West has been shaped by competition for land and scarce water resources. This chapter examines conflicts that have occurred between the needs of wildlife and those of humans who live and work in the western United States. Political conflict and resource competition are addressed through a series of case studies collectively illustrating the consequences of policy responses to resource issues that continue to threaten wildlife populations in the western states. Although there appears to be a growing trend toward policy collaboration on public lands (see Conley and Moote 2003; Cook 2000; Weber 1999, 2003), formulation and implementation of wildlife policy in the United States continue to be characterized by political conflict (Nie 2004). Supporters of community-based collaborative efforts argue that such efforts reduce conflicts and litigation (Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). However, political conflicts and legal cases concerning natural resources on public lands have not diminished (Comer 2004). George Cameron Coggins (1999) has observed that collaborative approaches that vest decision-making authority over federal resources to local groups represent an abdication of federal agency legal responsibility. In a detailed legal analysis of the role of collaborative groups in federal land management, Allyson Barker and colleagues (2003) examined legal precedents associated with the Administrative Procedure Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, and various organic acts of federal land management agencies and found that such groups may provide recommendations or information, but only federal agency decision makers have the authority to make decisions regarding the use of federal resources. Community-based collaborative efforts are further constrained in that agreements formulated through years of effort typically are not enforceable by law. Agreements established between federal agency officials and community- based collaborative groups may never be implemented if there is a change in administrations and the new administration does not support the policy. For example, the formal agreement made between the Quincy Library Group (QLG), one of a very few collaborative groups formally recognized by federal law, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service on logging the Sierra Nevadas in northern California was set aside by the Bush administration in 2001. The agreement had been established through negotiations with the USDA Forest Service during the Clinton administration. Following a lawsuit and congressional reauthorization of the Herger- Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act, in 2003 the QLG- initiated logging program was reinstituted. But environmentalists who were not given an opportunity to participate in the negotiations sued to prevent closed-door negotiations between QLG and the Forest Service (Little 2003). Political conflicts over natural resources appear to occur as a result of differences in values regarding how resources should be used or protected (Mangun and Henning 1999). Government action to deal with such conflict has been characterized as an ""authoritative allocation of values"" (Easton 1953). In this political process, governments decide who will get what and when, where, why, and how they will get it (Lasswell 1962). The history of the West has been shaped primarily by debates over who will get access to water or land resources (Stegner 1954; Worster 1985). In the past, wildlife has been inadequately represented in this political process. However, in recent decades an increasing amount of litigation has been initiated to protect wildlife at both the state and federal levels, as a result of the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973, the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1972, and similar legislation. Such actions have forced state and federal agencies to develop additional innovative policy actions to reverse a pervasive pattern of species decline. The western United States historically has provided a prime setting for large-scale human-wildlife conflicts that continue on a variety of spatial and temporal scales today. Some of the more striking and pervasive issues in wildlife policy and management in the West include a growing number of threatened, endangered, or declining wildlife populations; a related growth in human populations, leading to the destruction and fragmentation of wildlife habitat; and an increasingly scarce supply of water for both humans and wildlife in an arid environment. First, human contamination of water and soil can kill individual wildlife directly or can indirectly affect the vigor of entire populations by altering chromosomal patterns. Second, the rapidly increasing human population in the West continues to destroy or fragment wildlife habitat in an unprecedented manner. The resulting displacement overwhelms natural adaptive capacities for wildlife to modify their breeding habits and other life-maintenance functions. Third, the growing human demand for scarce water resources spurred by uncontrolled urban growth and development is significantly impacting aquatic and terrestrial species. The water policy practices that made settlement of the arid West possible, such as prior appropriation water laws, clearly favored, at some point, unwise growth and development. Large-scale federally funded water projects continue to enable an unsustainable explosion of agricultural and urban development in an otherwise unsuited environment. Another complicating issue is the virtual nonenforcement of official Bureau of Reclamation water allocation limits that permit distribution of federal water supplies to unofficial recipients, further reducing the availability of water for endangered fish and wildlife. The effects of these patterns are readily apparent throughout the West. California gnatcatchers, for example, are threatened by urban housing developments that destroy the coastal sage habitats in which they breed and live. San Joaquin kit foxes and blunt-nosed leopard lizards are endangered because of destruction of their essential breeding habitat by agricultural interests and urban developers in the California Central Valley. Wintering migratory waterfowl in the Kesterson Reservoir, near the California coast, are subjected to mutation-inducing chemicals in agricultural runoff from Central Valley irrigation ditches. Migratory shorebirds such as sandhill and whooping cranes that migrate across the High Plains are threatened by alterations in water flow at key staging areas on the Platte River in Nebraska. Important sandbar breeding habitat for endangered interior least terns and piping plovers, also on the High Plains, is either altered or destroyed by water management decisions made for agricultural purposes. Populations of endangered razorback suckers and Colorado topminnows (formerly squawfish) in the Colorado River are threatened by the loss of wetlands for breeding purposes, as well as by water projects that serve as barriers to migration or diminish instream flow. Over fifteen stocks of salmon and trout in the Columbia River basin have been listed as threatened or endangered as a result of high pollution levels, over-harvesting, and numerous water projects. The overall pattern is one of wildlife habitat destruction or significant reduction in habitat quality by an ever-increasing human population in the western states. But not all news is bad; there are also notable ""success"" stories concerning fish and wildlife in the West. The endangered black-footed ferret was practically extirpated from the High Plains as an unintended consequence of efforts to eradicate prairie dogs. Intensive conservation efforts have brought this species back from the brink of extinction, a population low of 38 individuals. Another species almost eliminated was the California condor, a majestic bird that possesses the largest wingspan of all North American birds. Human disturbance, poisoning, and habitat destruction forced the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove the last 26 California condors from the wild in the mid-1980s. After a major cooperative restoration effort involving several federal agencies, state governments, and the Peregrine Fund, over 200 California condors have been released into the wild. These birds continue to survive, although tenuously, in two populations within California and along the Arizona-Utah border. Not all wildlife policy ""success stories"" in the West have occurred as a result of management actions taken directly to conserve a particular species. Brown pelican and osprey populations along the Pacific Coast and, to some extent, bald eagle populations have recovered because of policies banning pesticides such as DDT. The banning of the infamous DDT (which promoted thinning of bird eggshells), and other lesser-known pesticides that deform or kill nontarget wildlife species, has occurred over concerns more about their effects on human health than their impacts on wildlife. The next section of this chapter describes the evolution of wildlife policy in the United States to facilitate a better understanding of different policy actions taken to conserve wildlife in the western states. Specific humanwildlife conflicts are described to illustrate how fish and wildlife have beenaffected by human competition for population-limiting resources, such as land and water. Government policy responses to such conflicts are described throughout the chapter, with reference to suggestions for future policy decisions concerning interaction between wildlife and humans in the West.

644,"A review of the current global status of blast fishing: Causes, implications and solutions","Blast fishing (known variously as dynamite and bomb fishing) has caused long-term damage to reefs and coastal livelihoods for decades. Blasting reefs with explosives provides fish for commercial and consumption purposes across the globe, but the practice has also led to large-scale destruction of coral reefs in much of Southeast Asia, Tanzania, the Red Sea, and other areas in Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. Despite its destructive nature and widespread dispersion, there have been few reviews that offer insight to assist in analysing and managing this broad-scale threat. We address this gap with a comprehensive global analysis of the blast fishing literature to explore the distribution of blast fishing, primary drivers, ecological and economic implications and solutions. Our review analysed 212 papers from seven databases. Blasting is widespread, misreported, and ongoing. Lack of effective enforcement and governance drives blasting; socioeconomic causes may contribute but are not dominant. A combination of deterrence measures and co-managed marine protected areas (MPAs) emerges as the most effective solution to blasting. Our review provides a basis upon which further analysis can build in order to better understand blast fishing and thereby improve conservation outcomes for coral reef ecosystems, as well as the outlook for fishing communities.

645,A community-based health education programme for bio-environmental control of malaria through folk theatre (Kalajatha) in rural India,"Background: Health education is an important component in disease control programme. Kalajatha is a popular, traditional art form of folk theatre depicting various life processes of a local socio-cultural setting. It is an effective medium of mass communication in the Indian sub-continent especially in rural areas. Using this medium, an operational feasibility health education programme was carried out for malaria control. Methods: In December 2001, the Kalajatha events were performed in the evening hours for two weeks in a malaria-affected district in Karnataka State, south India. Thirty local artists including ten governmental and non-governmental organizations actively participated. Impact of this programme was assessed after two months on exposed vs. non-exposed respondents. Results: The exposed respondents had significant increase in knowledge and change in attitude about malaria and its control strategies, especially on bio-environmental measures (p < 0.001). They could easily associate clean water with anopheline breeding and the role of larvivorous fish in malaria control. In 2002, the local community actively co-operated and participated in releasing larvivorous fish, which subsequently resulted in a noteworthy reduction of malaria cases. Immediate behavioural changes, especially maintenance of general sanitation and hygiene did not improve as much as expected. Conclusion: This study was carried out under the primary health care system involving the local community and various potential partners. Kalajatha conveyed the important messages on malaria control and prevention to the rural community. Similar methods of communication in the health education programme should be intensified with suitable modifications to reach all sectors, if malaria needs to be controlled.

647,"Marine Protected Areas in Fiji: A critical assessment of 'Community Fisheries Management and Development Plans' as a mechanism for formalising customary MPAs, in particular LMMAs","Fiji's National Government has committed to using Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to protect its marine environment. As Fiji is in the process of reforming its marine law, now is an opportune time to develop statutory mechanisms for establishing and regulating MPAs. This article considers the regulation of MPAs in Fiji's coastal waters - where the intersection of statutory and customary law poses particular challenges. 'Customary MPAs' already exist in Fiji's coastal environments, taking the form of tabu areas and 'Locally Managed Marine Areas' (LMMAs). Both of these are important mechanisms that any new statutory framework should incorporate and strengthen. In 2010, the draft Inshore Fisheries Decree (draft Inshore Decree) was prepared. Although the draft Inshore Decree appears to have stalled, it may yet be progressed to a final bill. Alternatively, some of the measures in it may be incorporated into another law. This article assesses one mechanism in the draft Inshore Decree that could be used to formalize customary MPAs - Community Fisheries Management and Development Plans (CFMDPs). It finds that CFMDPs demonstrate a number of strengths, in particular by supporting legal recognition of existing marine management measures. However, there are also weaknesses. Nevertheless, with refinement CFMDPs may be a useful tool for regulating Fiji's coastal MPAs.

648,Evaluation of coral reef management effectiveness using conventional versus resilience-based metrics,"With increasing stressors to coral reefs, defining tools that evaluate their dynamics and resilience is important to interpret system trajectories and direct conservation efforts. In this context, surveys must go beyond conventional monitoring approaches that focus on abundance and biomass of key groups and quantify metrics that better assess ecological processes and ecosystem trajectories. By measuring a variety of conventional (e.g. proportional cover of broad benthic groups, biomass of herbivorous fish) and complementary resilience-based metrics (e.g. algal turf height, coral recruitment rates, juvenile coral densities, herbivorous fish grazing rates), this study evaluated the ecosystem responses to community-based management in Fiji. The study was conducted across three paired tabu areas (periodically closed to fishing) and adjacent fished sites. Conventional metrics reflected no management effect on benthic or herbivorous fish assemblages. In contrast, the complementary metrics generally indicated positive effects of management, particularly within the benthos. Significant differences were observed for turf height (33% lower), coral recruitment rate (159% higher) and juvenile coral density (42% higher) within areas closed to fishing compared to adjacent open reefs. In addition, turf height was inversely related to coral recruitment and juvenile coral density, and longer turfs (Ã¢â€°Â¥5 mm) were more competitive in interaction with corals. These results emphasise that conventional metrics may overlook benefits of local management to inshore reefs, and that incorporating complementary resilience-based metrics such as turf height into reef survey protocols will strengthen their capacity to predict the plausible future condition of reefs and their responses to disturbances.

649,"Capacity building for tourism development in a nested social-ecological system-case study of the South Penghu Archipelago Marine National Park, Taiwan","In subnational small-island settings with a relatively undisturbed natural environment and an outmigration population, tourism development is often used as an alternative development strategy for economic and social regeneration. When such tourism development entails place-based management, such as in a marine protected area (MPA), tourism development can also be used as a strategy for alleviating the conflict between conservation and development as well as for increasing community participation. Local support and capacity building prior to tourism development are essential for involving local communities. Local communities are often complex and heterogeneous, and tourism development must be tailored to match their diverse needs. In this case study, three communities within the South Penghu Archipelago, where a marine national park and development of the tourism industry has been proposed, were investigated. This study assessed the perception of tourism development among community actors and the demands for capacity building to cope with future changes by conducting a social-ecological system (SES) analysis wherein the South Penghu MPA was considered a nested SES composed of subsystems. The subsystems focused on in this study were fishermen and nonfishermen at the functional scale and individual communities at the spatial scale. The results showed that the perceptions on tourism development varied substantially among the community actors and the different sub-SESs because of their different experiences in social-ecological interactions. Therefore, tourism development in a regional place-based management, such as in a MPA, must consider the various perceptions of such subsystems on tourism development. Rather than considering all local communities as a general unit, capacity building should be tailored to the needs of the community actors from the various sub-SESs. In addition, support from governmental agencies is essential for the success of community-based MPA policies.

650,An institutional model for comanagement of coastal resources in fiji,"In light of increasingly depleted coastal resources under the current management structure, this article explores the institutional arrangements that would be necessary in Fiji to create and implement a viable comanagement regime that would devolve some of the responsibility for management to the communities. Based on the literature concerning institutions for comanagement and the present situation and the institutional management structure in Fiji, it is recommended that government act as the catalyst by putting forth an enabling policy framework for comanagement that formally recognizes customary marine tenure. Such a policy should allow communities to derive bylaws from local rules, through shared management and technical assistance at the provincial level. At this same administrative level, planning units are recommended to coordinate government management of activities in the coastal zone.

Employing the appreciation-influence-control (AIC) model of participatory stakeholder engagement, the initiative built shared understanding of the sources of vulnerability in fisheries livelihoods and catalyzed collective action to support resilience in this valuable and productive social-ecological system. Outcomes include the transfer of a large, commercial fishing concession to community access, and resolution of a boundary dispute involving community fishery organizations in neighboring provinces. Motivated by these successes, the main national grassroots network representing fishing communities also modified its internal governance and strategy of engagement to emphasize constructive links with government and the formal NGO sector. The AIC approach, we argue, provides an effective route to enable collective action in ways that strengthen dialogue and collaboration across scales, fostering the conditions for local-level transformations that can contribute to improvement in governance.

652,Community based fisheries management and fisher livelihoods: Bangladesh case studies,"Poor fishers in Bangladesh have been disadvantaged by policies that favored powerful people leasing fishing rights. Community-based management was expected to improve fisher access, livelihoods, and the sustainability of fisheries. The impacts of community management in three floodplain waterbodies differed according to the environment and property rights. Where a set of fishers jointly held exclusive rights to a small enclosed lake they increased production by stocking fish and shared the returns. This strategy is productive but attracts competition for profits and fish consumption was unchanged. Access to capture fisheries in floodplain waterbodies enables the poor to catch diverse small fish for their consumption. Yet sustainability requires limits on fishing. Fish sanctuaries were respected, yet catches per day fell when more people from several villages increased fishing effort in a large wetland, while a tightly knit community restored the fishery in a smaller floodplain. Community organizations will need recognition of their long-term use rights to overcome future threats.

Such traditional conservation regimes may break down as a result of influences from the outside world. This paper examines two cases in Taiwan-the Tao communities on Orchid Island and the Atayal community in Smangus. The former illustrates a process in which traditional institutions supporting local conservation broke down as a result of external influences, leading to the loss of the local community's ability to govern the use of a coastal fishery. The latter, in contrast, demonstrates how local people are able to adapt their traditional institutions to meet the challenges from the outside world while preserving a local forest.

655,Multiple drivers of local (non-) compliance in community-based marine resource management: Case studies from the South Pacific,"The outcomes of marine conservation and related management interventions depend to a large extent on people's compliance with these rule systems. In the South Pacific, community-based marine resource management (CBMRM) has gained wide recognition as a strategy for the sustainable management of marine resources. In current practice, CBMRM initiatives often build upon customary forms of marine governance, integrating scientific advice and management principles in collaboration with external partners. However, diverse socio-economic developments as well as limited legal mandates can challenge these approaches. Compliance with and effective (legally-backed) enforcement of local management strategies constitute a growing challenge for communities-often resulting in considerable impact on the success or failure of CBMRM. Marine management arrangements are highly dynamic over time, and similarly compliance with rule systems tends to change depending on context. Understanding the factors contributing to (non-) compliance in a given setting is key to the design and function of adaptive management approaches. Yet, few empirical studies have looked in depth into the dynamics around local (non-) compliance with local marine tenure rules under the transforming management arrangements. Using two case studies from Solomon Islands and Fiji, we investigate what drives local (non-) compliance with CBMRM and what hinders or supports its effective enforcement. The case studies reveal that non-compliance is mainly driven by: (1) diminishing perceived legitimacy of local rules and rule-makers; (2) increased incentives to break rules due to market access and/ or lack of alternative income; and (3) relatively weak enforcement of local rules (i.e., low perceptions of risk from sanctions for rule-breaking). These drivers do not stand alone but can act together and add up to impair effective management. We further analyze how enforcement of CBMRM is challenged through a range of institutional; socio-cultural and technical/financial constraints, which are in parts a result of the dynamism and ongoing transformations of management arrangements. Our study underlines the importance of better understanding and contextualizing marine resource management processes under dynamic conditions for an improved understanding of compliance in a particular setting.

658,Assessment of the stock status of small-scale and multi-gear fisheries resources in the tropical Eastern Pacific region,"Small-scale multi-gear fisheries contribute half of global fisheries landings but are generally data-poor, hindering their assessment and management. Aiming to overcome various existing challenges, we used two complementary length-based approaches to assess the status of three main target species in the small-scale fisheries of Eastern Pacific countries: Spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus, Pacific sierra Scomberomorus sierra, and Pacific bearded Brotula clarkae, using length-frequency catch data (LFCD) from the Colombian Pacific coast. Two data sources Ã¢â‚¬â€œ official governmental data and community-based monitoring from a non-government organization Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were used to estimate two sets of stock indicators: one based on the derivation of growth and mortality parameters from modal progression, catch curve analysis and a yield-per-recruit model using TropFishR; and the second based on the relative contribution of fish sizes with regard to proposed reference values for healthy stocks. Growth estimates differed between data sources and exhibited large confidence intervals, indicating an overall high uncertainty underlying the LFCD revealed through a novel bootstrapped approach. Estimated values of stock indicators, exploitation rate, fishing mortality and size-proportions converged in suggesting a state of heavy to over-exploitation for the three assessed species, although differences were observed among data sources that we attribute mainly to fisheries selectivity and sampling design. In order to improve future assessments of stocks in multi-gear and data-poor contexts, estimations of fleet-specific selectivity should be used to reconstruct LFCD prior to analyses. Additionally, sampling design should be based on fishing effort distribution among gears and areas and, when feasible, fishery-independent data on stock conditions should be included.

659,"Role of Marine National Park for Sustainable Livelihoods of Artisan Fisherfolk: A Case Study of MNP, Jamnagar","Over the past few decades, marine conservation has become a global concern due to increasing anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of coastal areas, which has led to the development of the concept of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) for the conservation of marine ecology and its biodiversity. Conservation and acceptance of MPAs can only be achieved if coastal communities and fisherfolk are included as significant stakeholders because MPAs have direct relevance to their livelihood. To capture their acceptance towards the Gulf of Kachchh Marine National Park (MNP), Jamnagar, artisanal fisherfolk fishing in and around the MNP were surveyed to determine whether the presence of a wellmanaged MNP has any positive effects on the adjacent fishing communities since its establishment. The survey was carried out at six sites along the coast of southern Gulf of Kachchh (Sachana, Jodiya, Sikka, Salaya, Arambada, and Bet Dwarka) using structured questionnaires. The findings showed that the total fish catch was observed to increase over the years, but there has been a perceived decline in total catch in recent years. Similarly, while the total fish catch data recorded an increasing trend, discussions with the fisherfolk revealed a sharp decline in Ã¢â‚¬â€¢catch per unit effortÃ¢â‚¬â€“ in recent years.

660,Perceptions of access and benefits from community-based aquaculture through Photovoice: A case study within a locally managed marine area in Madagascar,"Small-scale fishers face a range of local and global environmental pressures including declining fish stocks and climate change. In coastal southwest Madagascar, community-based aquaculture (CBA) projects have been established within a locally managed marine area (LMMA) to provide alternative income streams for small-scale fishing communities and support community efforts in reducing local fishing pressures. This study focused on understanding community perceptions of both access to, and benefits from, two CBA projects within the Velondriake LMMA involving seaweed and sea cucumber aquaculture. Participants included seaweed farmers, sea cucumber farmers, and non-farmers, and research considered the impacts of the projects at the individual and community level. Participatory field research was conducted in Tampolove, Madagascar during 2018 using an adapted Photovoice method with participant-based photos and in-depth interviews. The integration of CBA projects into the LMMA resulted in a new governance model, with the aquaculture sites requiring Ã¢â‚¬Ëœprivate accessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ within a historically Ã¢â‚¬Ëœopen-accessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ setting. Results showed that community members accepted this access change for the community's coastal area, with aquaculture benefits including more predictable income generation and benefit-sharing across the community, appearing to outweigh the loss of access to part of their traditional fishing grounds. However, further research is required to better understand how women and other marginalised community members are affected. Due to the benefits cited by community members, the CBA-LMMA model may have applicability to other coastal community settings in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) where there is both a need and opportunity for positive alignment of community-based alternative livelihoods and marine conservation.

662,Community based ecological mangrove rehabilitation (CBEMR) in Indonesia: From small (12-33 ha) to medium scales (400 ha) with pathways for adoption at larger scales (>5000 ha),"While successful examples of large-scale (5 000-10 000 ha) ecological wetland/mangrove rehabilitation projects exist worldwide, mangrove rehabilitation efforts in Indonesia, both large and small, have mainly failed. The majority of projects (both government programs and non-government initiatives) have oversimplified the technical processes of mangrove rehabilitation, favouring the direct planting of a restricted subset of mangrove species (from the family Rhizophoracea), commonly in the lower half of the intertidal system (from Mean Sea Level down to Lowest Atmospheric Tide) where mangroves, by and large, do not naturally grow. Aside from lack of appropriate technical assessment, these lower inter-tidal mudflats are often targeted for rehabilitation because true degraded mangrove forests are frequently linked to tenurial issues that require significant effort and investment to resolve. Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (EMR) has been implemented and well documented for the past several decades in New World mangrove systems (Lewis, 2005, 2009b) and was selected as a best practice for adaptation and trials in Indonesia. Whereas in the US, the five-step process primarily focuses on biophysical assessments and eco-hydrological repair, when applied to the Indonesian scenario, EMR requires both lower-cost biophysical approaches and greater attention to socio-cultural-political approaches common in sustainable development and coastal resource management programs. The adaptation of EMR was initially tested in small-scale projects, ranging from 12-33 ha in sites from the islands of Sumatera and Sulawesi. Biophysical adaptations included use of low-cost biophysical assessment methods, reliance on manual labour, strategic breaching of aquaculture ponds dike walls, manual construction of tidal channels, and human assisted propagule dispersal while socio-political adaptations included land tenure settlement, increased use of training of trainers programs, gender assessments and sensitisation, enhanced community organising, coordination with numerous government agencies and participatory monitoring. Initial projects succeeded in rehabilitating mangrove coverage and diversity, while catalysing community-based or collaborative management. The most recent Community Based Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation (CBEMR) project took place on Tanakeke Island, South Sulawesi, where 1776 ha of mangroves were reduced to approximately 576 ha over two decades due to development of 1200 ha of aquaculture ponds. The proven effectiveness of the CBEMR process at small and medium scales relies on its ability to resolve both biophysical and socio-political issues underscoring mangrove forest degradation in Indonesia. If and when this is applied to large-scale restoration, it is sure that continued attention will need to be paid to both biophysical and socio-political approaches.

663,Community-based management induces rapid recovery of a high-value tropical freshwater fishery,"Tropical wetlands are highly threatened socio-ecological systems, where local communities rely heavily on aquatic animal protein, such as fish, to meet food security. Here, we quantify how a 'win-win' community-based resource management program induced stock recovery of the world's largest scaled freshwater fish (Arapaima gigas), providing both food and income. We analyzed stock assessment data over eight years and examined the effects of protected areas, community-based management, and landscape and limnological variables across 83 oxbow lakes monitored along a Ã¢Ë†Â¼500-km section of the JuruÃƒÂ¡ River of Western Brazilian Amazonia. Patterns of community management explained 71.8% of the variation in arapaima population sizes. Annual population counts showed that protected lakes on average contained 304.8 (Ã‚Â±332.5) arapaimas, compared to only 9.2 (Ã‚Â±9.8) in open-access lakes. Protected lakes have become analogous to a high-interest savings account, ensuring an average annual revenue of US$10,601 per community and US$1046.6 per household, greatly improving socioeconomic welfare. Arapaima management is a superb window of opportunity in harmonizing the co-delivery of sustainable resource management and poverty alleviation.

664,"Balancing ecology, economy and culture in fisheries policy: Participatory research in the Western Mediterranean demersal fisheries management plan","Fishing communities in the Mediterranean Sea face challenges in dealing with Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) ecosystem-based management measures aimed at reducing fishing effort and implementing partial closures of fisheries. The Participatory Action Research method is used here as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“pilot experienceÃ¢â‚¬Â to gather reactions from fishers, scientists and fisheries managers to the Western Mediterranean Multi-Annual Demersal Fisheries Plan (WM MAP) by identifying needs and concerns, but also alternatives to maintain the viability of the fishery. The data gathering process consisted on a structured questionnaire administered during a workshop to 40 stakeholders involved in Spanish fisheries in the Mediterranean, followed by an open discussion session. The results show that fishers disagree with the new regulations, which they perceive as yet another layer of restrictive regulations for an industry that faces major challenges and currently has low profitability, whereas scientists tended to agree more with the WM MAP than the administration or the fishers. Nevertheless, all stakeholders agree that the values of the cultural heritage of fisheries and the exploration of alternative marketing systems should balance the productivity-based approach to fisheries policies followed so far, that have shown signs of failure. According to stakeholder perceptions, this would improve the economic and social viability of fisheries, as well as highlight the value of fishing activity and its social prestige. Integrating the value of cultural heritage and post-production processes into the CFP would improve stakeholder involvement in fisheries policies. Through participatory research methods the ecosystem-based management approach could be embedded in a community-based approach, integrating its social actors in a proactive attitude and considering fisheries as a human activity socially and culturally rooted in the environment, which would enhance the effective implementation of fisheries policies.

665,Quantifying Variability in Four U.S. Streams Using a Long-Term Dataset: Patterns in Biotic Endpoints,"Effective water resources assessment and management requires quantitative information on the variability of ambient and biological conditions in aquatic communities. Although it is understood that natural systems are variable, robust estimates of long-term variation in community-based structure and function metrics are rare in U.S. waters. We used a multi-year, seasonally sampled dataset from multiple sites (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6) in four streams (Codorus Creek, PA; Leaf River, MS; McKenzie and Willamette Rivers, OR) to examine spatial and temporal variation in periphyton chlorophyll a, and fish and macroinvertebrate metrics commonly used in bioassessment programs. Within-site variation of macroinvertebrate metrics and benthic chlorophyll a concentration showed coefficient of variation ranging from 16 to 136Ã‚Â %. Scale-specific variability patterns (stream-wide, season, site, and site-season patterns) in standardized biotic endpoints showed that within-site variability patterns extended across sites with variability greatest in chlorophyll a and lowest in HilsenhoffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Biotic Index. Across streams, variance components models showed that variance attributed to the interaction of space and time and sample variance accounted for the majority of variation in macroinvertebrate metrics and chlorophyll a, while most variation in fish metrics was attributed to sample variance. Clear temporal patterns in measured endpoints were rare and not specific to any one stream or assemblage, while apparent shifts in metric variability related to point source discharges were seen only in McKenzie River macroinvertebrate metrics in the fall.

666,The panglima laot of Aceh: A case study in large-scale community-based marine management after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami,"Abstract Despite dating back over 400 years the relevance of traditional fisheries management in Aceh, Indonesia, still remains high. Aceh was, however, greatly affected by the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that claimed an estimated 167,000 lives, including 14,000 fishermen and 59 of the 193 traditional marine leaders (Panglima Laot). This tragic loss of life was accompanied by a substantial loss of local knowledge, such as the locations of hazardous fishing grounds. In this study we describe an innovative project that sought to rebuild a post-tsunami fisheries sector by re-engaging and empowering the Panglima Laot. During April-June 2008 GPS (global positioning system) sounding devices were installed on 53 local fishing boats and hazardous fishing areas mapped based on local knowledge, and shared amongst fishermen. During July-December 2008 nearly five million GPS data points were collected, from which detailed bathymetric maps were produced and shared between fishermen and Aceh government officials. Significant project outputs included a map of fishing areas over 20,000-km2, which included three new seamounts, one of which expanded Aceh's provincial boundary by &gt;-1.3 million ha, and a Panglima Laot decree that reduced fishing in hazardous areas of high coral density by 23.3%. Our findings have wide applicability. Locally, the introduction of GPS technology and sharing of traditional knowledge resulted in fishermen developing and implementing their own management strategies and demonstrating their ability to stay out of restricted areas. Provincially, this project provided a framework through which government agencies and academic institutions could effectively engage with local customary leaders and their fishing communities.

Results: The prevalences of anti-HBV core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and anti-HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) were 33.1, 10.4, and 56.1%, respectively. We found statistically significant differences of HBV markers in men versus women (P<0.01). The prevalence of HBV infection increased with age. There were significant differences in the rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc positivity between the two islands (P<0.01). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated (>38 IU/L) in 15.6% and 7.2% of the HBsAg-positive and negative groups, respectively. Elevated ALT levels were significantly higher in males (12.0%) compared with females (5.8%) (P<0.01). The ÃŽÂ±-fetoprotein (AFP) positivity rate was 0.6% in HBsAg-positive participants over the age of 30. Conclusion: Due to the geographic location, we found that the HBV prevalence and potential for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma remained high in insular regions of southeast China, and are far above the national figures. Although a vaccination program has been in effect over the last 20 years, several additional measures should be adopted by the government to limit the spread of hepatitis B. These include the management of high risk persons and the floating population living on the islands, expansion of the immune population, and increased health education for fisherman.

669,Assessing the small-scale shark fishery of Madagascar through community-based monitoring and knowledge,"Over 90% of those employed in commercial capture fisheries work in the small-scale fisheries (SSF) sector and an estimated 97% of small scale fishers are found in least developed countries. However, the capacity for monitoring SSF globally is low and there is a paucity of data, in particular for remote areas within developing nations. The methods presented here demonstrate a low cost participatory approach for gathering data on small-scale fisheries, in particular for those that take place across remote areas. Community-based data collectors were trained to record biological and socioeconomic data on the traditional (non-motorised) shark fishery in the Toliara region of Madagascar over a six year period (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012). An estimated 20 species of shark were recorded, of which 31% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3505) were Sphyrna lewini (scalloped hammerhead), a species listed by the IUCN as Endangered (IUCN, 2016). Although the number of sharks landed annually has not decreased during our survey period, there was a significant decrease in the average size of sharks caught. Despite multiple anecdotal reports of shark population declines, interviews and focus groups highlight the possibility that shark landings appear to have been maintained through changes in gear and increases in effort (eg. number of fishers, time spent fishing), which may mask a decline in shark populations. The numbers of sharks taken by the traditional fishery in our study region was estimated to be between 65,000 and 104,000Ã‚Â yearÃ¢Ë†â€™1, whilst estimates using national export and import of dried shark fin from Madagascar, and shark length data in this study, put total landings between 78,000 and 471,851Ã‚Â yearÃ¢Ë†â€™1. Reliable data on the total volume of sharks landed in Madagascar's waters is scarce, in particular from foreign industrial boats both directly targeting shark species and as bycatch in fisheries targeting other species.

670,Madagascar,"MadagascarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive coastline supports a rapidly growing coastal population in both urban and rural areas. Habitats include corals reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds estuarine mud flats, rocky shores, and sandy beaches. Small-scale fisheries are the primary source of nutrition and income for coastal communities, particularly in western Madagascar, and they target a broad range of fish and invertebrates. There is a long history of overfishing for small-scale fisheries in Madagascar, with many being overexploited and some close to collapse. The absence of small-scale fisheries management has led to a rapid rise in community-based initiatives with technical support provided by international and national nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Global climate change is predicted to affect the marine and coastal environments of Madagascar through changes in many abiotic factors. Madagascar is ranked as one of the tropical coastal nations with the lowest adaptive capacity and highest vulnerability to climate change. Given the forecast trends, climate change represents a critical threat to food security for many of the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coastal communities. Communities dependent on coral reef fisheries are likely to see the most marked declines in fisheries productivity. When combined with projected increases in coastal population, it is likely that the nutritional requirements of marine resource-dependent coastal communities in south-west Madagascar will no longer be met by small-scale fisheries by 2050. There is a critical need to identify and implement strategies to enable MadagascarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s small-scale fishing communities to adapt to climate change over the coming decades. Recommendations provided focus on increasing the socio-ecological resilience of coastal and marine ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. Ã‚Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

671,Perceptions of obvious and disruptive climate change: Community-based risk assessment for two native villages in Alaska,"This work operationalizes the determinants of climate change risk, exposure and vulnerability, through the perceptions held by Native hunters, fishers, and gatherers in Savoonga and Shaktoolik, Alaska. Informed by their skill, experience, and the traditional knowledge of their elders, hunters, fishers, and gatherers in these communities are astute observers of their environment and environmental change. A questionnaire is used to sort and rank their perceptions of the most obvious and disruptive elements of climate change as representations of exposure and vulnerability, respectively. Results represent the relative strength and significance of those perceptions of environmental change. In addition to other changes, storms are among the most obvious and disruptive impacts of climate change to respondents in both communities, while changes to sea ice tend to be more disruptive in Savoonga, a more ice-obligate culture, than Shaktoolik. Changes on the tundra are more obvious in Shaktoolik, but is the least disruptive category of change in both villages. Changes along the coast were both obvious and disruptive, albeit more so in Shaktoolik than Savoonga. The findings suggest that traditional ecological knowledge is a valuable source of information to access perceptions of risk, and develop climate risk management and adaptation plans. The questionnaire design and statistical methodology may be of interest to those working on community-based adaptation and risk assessment projects in high-risk, poor, and marginalized Native communities with small populations.

672,An overview of fishing rights,"Coastal state management of marine harvests within 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones was a new and innovative process during the period from the late 1970s through the 1980s. The spread of conservation-focused harvest management was a key step in the evolution of fishing rights, followed in some nations by a second step of creating more exclusive, individual or group fishing rights. The three main forms of more exclusive fishing rights - limited entry permits, individual fishing quotas (IFQs), and local community-based or co-operative harvesting - vary widely in content and detail. But, when successful, they all increase the economic efficiency of fisheries, and they reshape the economic and political landscape of fisheries. All three types, but particularly IFQs, may initiate radical changes in the economic organization of the fishery, ultimately changing who fishes, where and when they fish, the products sold, the balance of power among industry sectors, incentives to support conservation, the size of incomes from fishing, and the location of shore-side economic activity. Changes of this sort are bound to provoke controversy. The controversies over fishing rights take three forms: Disagreements over the meaning and intent of fishing rights, disputes over the distribution of rights and associated economic gain, and concern for disruptions imposed on people who are dependent on the ""old order"". This paper provides a short review of the underlying concepts, rights systems, and current controversies concerning fishing rights.

675,Scleractinian coral communities of the inner Seychelles 10 years after the 1998 mortality event,"The size structure and taxonomic composition of coral communities in the inner (Granitic) Seychelles were studied 10 years after a thermal stress-induced mass mortality event.A survey of the abundance, population size structure and community composition of hard corals across 21 sites from three different geomorphological reef types on the Seychelles Bank provided high resolution data for discriminating coral communities based on diversity, taxonomic composition, colony abundance, surface area and size frequency distributions.Results emphasize the severely impoverished and depauperate nature of inner Seychelles hard coral communities, which had lower generic diversity (40 genera recorded), and lower abundance (3.3 colonies m-2) of hard corals (excluding juveniles) than other coral reef regions of the Indian Ocean for which comparable data are currently available.Analysis of coral communities indicated that management had no appreciable effect on juvenile or adult coral abundance at this point in time, and that low juvenile density (9.9 colonies m-2) may severely limit recovery of many individual reefs in the inner Seychelles.While some sites were found to have appreciable coral cover (&gt;20%), others, including long-standing protected areas with no fishing, are now in an advanced state of erosion and framework collapse with very low juvenile coral replenishment and negligible available hard substratum suitable for coral settlement.Some of these reefs may have passed the threshold of viable recovery, now being in a self-reinforcing, non-coral dominated erosional phase.These findings indicate variable coral community condition, with many sites showing little sign of recovery. If persistence of live hard coral is a management goal, the existing protected areas within the Seychelles Bank may require review to ensure protection of sites with high recovery potential, while a suite of other management tools should be implemented in the remaining areas.

676,Dispersal of grouper larvae drives local resource sharing in a coral reef fishery,"In many tropical nations, fisheries management requires a community-based approach because small customary marine tenure areas define the spatial scale of management [1]. However, the fate of larvae originating from a community's tenure is unknown, and thus the degree to which a community can expect their management actions to replenish the fisheries within their tenure is unclear [2, 3]. Furthermore, whether and how much larval dispersal links tenure areas can provide a strong basis for cooperative management [4, 5]. Using genetic parentage analysis, we measured larval dispersal from a single, managed spawning aggregation of squaretail coral grouper (Plectropomus areolatus) and determined its contribution to fisheries replenishment within five community tenure areas up to 33 km from the aggregation at Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. Within the community tenure area containing the aggregation, 17%-25% of juveniles were produced by the aggregation. In four adjacent tenure areas, 6%-17% of juveniles were from the aggregation. Larval dispersal kernels predict that 50% of larvae settled within 14 km of the aggregation. These results strongly suggest that both local and cooperative management actions can provide fisheries benefits to communities over small spatial scales.

677,Joint species models reveal the effects of environment on community assemblage of freshwater mussels and fishes in European rivers,"Aim: Given that riverine systems exhibit longitudinal environmental gradients from headwater to the mouth of a river, habitat heterogeneity appears to be a major driver of spatial variation in community composition among riverine localities. As freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most endangered ecosystems in the world, community-based conservation and multiple-species management are necessary to maintain ecosystem integrity. We used joint species distribution models (JSDMs) to investigate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors that are responsible for the distribution and co-occurrence of species in riverine ecosystems. Location: Central and northern Europe. Methods: We examined the general patterns of species assemblage of two endangered freshwater mussel species (Margaritifera margaritifera and Unio crassus) and their associated fish communities. We examined the patterns of positive or negative co-occurrence in mussel and fish species and identified shared abiotic responses between musselÃ¢â‚¬â€œhost pairs. Results: We found that the relative importance of abiotic and residual factors and patterns of significant species correlations varied among taxa: significant residual correlations were prevalent among fish species, whereas mussel occurrences were exclusively explained by abiotic factors. Mussels and their fish hosts generally had shared abiotic responses with some mismatched responses between musselÃ¢â‚¬â€œhost pairs. Main conclusions: Given that the composition of communities were tightly linked with abiotic factors and residual correlations, the results have significant implications for the conservation and restoration of aquatic communities. This study highlights the necessity to simultaneously consider environmental factors and species co-occurrences in the modelling of species distributions and assemblages of riverine communities. Such a holistic community conservation approach can reveal ecological similarities and differences among species, which can help us avoid conflicts among target-species conservation plans.

679,"Marine mammals used as bait for improvised fish aggregating devices in marine waters of Ecuador, eastern tropical Pacific","Fish aggregating devices (FADs) are floating objects typically used to attract and capture pelagic fish in industrial tuna fisheries. This study documents 9 cases, involving 31 marine mammals, of incidentally captured, killed or otherwise retrieved cetaceans and pinnipeds which were used, or presumably used, as bait for improvised fish aggregation devices (IFAD) by artisanal fishers in coastal Ecuador. At least 3 species of small cetaceans were affected, including pantropical spotted dolphin Stenella attenuata, short-finned pilot whale Globicephala macro - rhynchus, pygmy killer whale Feresa attenuata and an unidentified small delphinid, as well as South American sea lions Otaria byronia which were reportedly killed on purpose for this fishing practice. A sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus and a humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae were presumably found floating at sea and opportunistically exploited as FADs. The South American sea lion represented 80.6% of marine mammals used as bait associated with FADs (25 sea lions out of 31 marine mammals), while the remaining 5 (possibly 6) cetacean species represented 19.4%. This is the first report of baited FADs in Ecuador, the extent of which is still unknown. This fishing technique has not been documented in other nations along the west coast of South America, although baiting of gillnets with marine mammal parts is common in Peru. Without fisheries management and regulation, this illegal fishing practice could rapidly expand and lead to further direct kills and conservation problems for targeted marine mammal populations in the eastern tropical Pacific.

681,"Comparison of fish detections, community diversity, and relative abundance using environmental DNA metabarcoding and traditional gears","Background: Detecting species at low abundance, including aquatic invasive species (AIS), is critical for making informed management decisions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have become a powerful tool for rare or cryptic species detection; however, many eDNA assays offer limited utility for community-level analyses due to their use of species-specific (presence/absence) Ã¢â‚¬ËœbarcodesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Metabarcoding methods provide information on entire communities based on sequencing of all taxon-specific barcodes within an eDNA sample. Aims: Evaluate measures of fish species detections, community diversity, and estimates of relative abundance based on eDNA metabarcoding and traditional fisheries sampling approaches in the context of fish community characterization and AIS survellience. Materials and Methods: In 2016, eight limnologically diverse lakes (surface area range: 13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1,728 ha) in Michigan, USA were sampled using a variety of traditional fisheries gears to characterize fish community composition. Environmental DNAs from surface (33 Ã‚Â± 6, mean Ã‚Â± 1 SD) and benthic (14 Ã‚Â± 2) water samples from each lake were isolated and amplified for two metabarcoding markers (mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA loci) using fish-specific primers. Fish species detected within each lake were determined by comparing the sequencing data to a database of sequences from native Michigan fish species and 19 AIS on the Michigan's Watch List. Results: Analysis of species accumulation curves indicated multi-locus eDNA metabarcoding assays can enhance species detection capacities and characterize 95% of a fish community in fewer sampling efforts than traditional gear (range: 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 62, median: 14). In addition, all AIS detected in traditional gear samples were also detected by eDNA, while some AIS detected by eDNA assays were absent from traditional gear samples. Discussion: Results reported here are, in part, driven by the lack of species-selectivity during eDNA sampling events. Given the efficacy of eDNA assays, we suggest multi-locus eDNA metabarcoding assays be implemented in early detection efforts. Ã‚Â© 2019 The Authors.

682,Economic efficiency of community-based flood risk management: An empirical study from Indonesia,"Flood risk management are considerably influenced by several factors, such as all sources of flooding, social circum-stances, policy and even the potential for local economic growth. To encourage government, business, community and oth-er parties to continue investing in flood risk management projects, it is necessary to give understanding that the projects can also provide economic benefits through systematic predictions and assessments of costs, benefits and social values, espe-cially on flood-affected communities. This study aims: (1) to develop knowledge and understanding on small-scale flood risk management project in Malang City, Indonesia, and; (2) to assess the economic efficiency of the project investment considering all benefits, both monetary and non-monetary. The research method is a mixed method combining quantitative questionnaires (N = 53 from 162 families) with qualitative in-depth interviews (N = 10) and field observations. The runoff discharge and the inundation depth were calculated using hydrology and hydraulic analysis, while the economic efficiency was analysed using cost benefit analysis (CBA). The results show that the community-based flood risk management system can reduce the flood risk up to 30% compared to before the implementation of that system. This system also provides direct financial benefits through the use of drainage channels for fish and vegetables farming. It causes the increase of the net so-cial benefit about 70-90% and the net present value (NPV) greater than zero (NPV > 0). Therefore, the project investment is recommended to be proceeded.

683,Historical contentions and future trends in the coastal zones: The environmental movement in Puerto Rico,"A ""new"" space for leisure and a landscape of high aesthetic value, the coastal zone of Puerto Rico attracts numerous visitors and investors.1 With commodification, coastal lands are attracting well-to-do home buyers who are displacing long-term local residents of rural coastal communities, fishing villages, and small harbors. Real estate development has focused on construction of condos, resorts, and houses, sold at prices that make them unaffordable for a local population suffering from unemployment and poverty. Having observed the growth of recreational activities and infrastructure on the coast (ValdÃƒÂ©s Pizzini, Chaparro, and GutiÃƒÂ©rrez 1991), in 1992 my colleague Jaime GutiÃƒÂ©rrez SÃƒÂ¡nchez and I embarked on an investigation of this transformation and the associated displacement of traditional settlers. One aspect of this investigation was a study of local responses to the environmental impacts of coastal development. This process of ""coastal gentrification"" entails new architecture, social practices, lifestyles, languages, and ethnic groups (Smith 1996, 41; Iranzo 1996). We assumed that gentrification, along with development and urbanization, was highly correlated with an increase in community-based and environmental organizations. These organizations were formed to protect nature and to preserve the social and cultural integrity of local communities threatened by economic change. Our previous research on fishing communities gave us a relatively thorough understanding of socioeconomic and landscape transformations in the western municipality of Cabo Rojo (see ValdÃƒÂ©s Pizzini, GutiÃƒÂ©rrez SÃƒÂ¡nchez, and GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, forthcoming). Building on the Cabo Rojo case, we designed an exploratory project in the municipalities of GuÃƒÂ¡nica and Lajas in the southwest of the island, and in Aguada and RincÃƒÂ³n in the west. Drawing on the results of this project, this chapter addresses the environmental problems occurring in Puerto Rico's coastal zone and offers a historical perspective on the environmental movements that developed in response to these problems.3 I argue that unsustainable growth in the coastal zone is to be expected. Therefore, civil society will continue to play a key role in the stewardship of nature and the integrity and health of coastal communities and marine ecosystems. The main challenge for the environmental movement will be to develop, engage in, and transform the policies and politics of sustainability. Universities can play a critical role in capacity building and policy making related to this issue. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2006 by Sherrie L. Baver and Barbara Deutsch Lynch.

684,Governing aquaculture: Dynamics and diversity in introducing salmon farming in scotland,"This chapter discusses several ways of approaching governing situations in salmon farming in Scotland and the Shetlands. The official position had always been that salmon farming and nature conservation go together perfectly, obviating need for coastal zones specially designated to marine fish farming development in Scotland. The chapter explains the need for action co-ordination of salmon farmers sharing a common water body to prevent the outbreak of pests and disease epidemics. From a communicative-action perspective, co-ordinated action at the local level does not necessarily depend solely or mainly on social co-ordination mechanisms, as has been suggested by community-based management advocates. From a socio-political perspective, the chapter describes the development of the coastal zone with the help of a theory of communicative action, as well as a model of local control over local resource exploitation.

685,"Socio-ecological and livelihood assessment of selected coastal areas in Sorsogon, Philippines","A study was conducted to assess the productive capacity of five villages namely Gimagaan, Sevilla, Sogoy, Milagrosa and Saclayan in Sorsogon, Philippines. Specifically, it aimed to assess the productive resource base, resource use and livelihood patterns and provide management prescriptions in the transition of farms into organic agriculture. Sustainable livelihoods analysis and participatory rapid appraisal were the analytical frameworks used in the study. Result of the study revealed that Gimagaan village had the greatest access to asset capitals compared to the other four villages in Sorsogon, Philippines. Gimagaan village highly benefited from the presence of socio-civic and government organizations, residents are more socially inclined and actively involved in the various social activities, have generally good access to their natural resource stocks and infrastructure facilities. On sustainability assessment, results revealed that Milagrosa village was more capable of sustaining management systems of its natural resources, highly resilient against perturbations and had greater chances of improving capacities for social development enterprises. Saclayan village on the other hand, had the lowest access to asset capitals and lowest score in terms of sustainability indicators. Management prescriptions include introduction of farming and fishing technologies which do not require intensive capital; conduct of an in-depth study of fishery-based livelihood project; strengthening the establishment of community-based sanctuaries and mangrove areas; introduction of crop-diversification farming system; and strengthening of the production-market linkage for fishery-based livelihood projects.",NA,No,"The study is based in the Philippines, not in any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The study is clearly stated to be conducted in Sorsogon, Philippines, which is not one of the countries listed in the SC.

Coral reef health surrounding four island case studies in the Cook Islands and Fiji have been assessed in areas that have not been previously surveyed. This study compares four islands with barrier and fringing reefs that have different levels of economic development, population pressure, land-use practices, and marine management practices. This interdisciplinary research methodology includes both ecological and social data collection to further understanding of human environment interactions. In comparing the reefs with different socio-economic factors, this research shows that reefs with traditional systems of resources management are healthier, population pressure is not the main factor causing the demise of the reefs and agro-industry is the main industry causing the degradation of the reef in these four South Pacific Islands.

687,"Biocultural restoration of traditional agriculture: Cultural, environmental, and economic outcomes of Lo'i Kalo restoration in He'eia, O'ahu","There are growing efforts around the world to restore biocultural systems that produce food while also providing additional cultural and ecological benefits. Yet, there are few examples of integrated assessments of these efforts, impeding understanding of how they can contribute to multi-level sustainability goals. In this study, we collaborated with a community-based non-profit in He'eia, O'ahu to evaluate future scenarios of traditional wetland and flooded field system agriculture (lo'i kalo; taro fields) restoration in terms of locally-relevant cultural, ecological, and economic outcomes as well as broader State of Hawai'i sustainability goals around food, energy, and water. Families participating in the biocultural restoration program described a suite of community and cultural benefits stemming from the process of restoration, including enhanced social connections, cultural (re)connections to place, and physical and mental well-being, which inspired their sustained participation. We also found benefits in terms of local food production that have the potential to provide economic returns and energy savings over time, particularly when carried out through a hybrid non-profit and family management model. These benefits were coupled with potential changes in sediment and nutrient retention with implications for water quality and the health of an important downstream fish pond (loko i'a) and coral reef social-ecological system. Compared with the current land cover (primarily invasive grasses), results suggest that full restoration of lo'i kalo would decrease sediment export by ~38%, but triple nitrogen export due to organic fertilizer additions. However, compared with an urban scenario, there were clear benefits of agricultural restoration in terms of reduced nitrogen and sediment runoff. In combination, our results demonstrate that a biocultural approach can support the social and financial sustainability of agricultural systems that provide multiple benefits valued by the local community and non-profit while also contributing to statewide sustainability goals.

690,Validity of the Fisher Community Knowledge-Based Economic Valuation of the Local Ecosystem for Oyster Farming: A Case Study in Japan,"The importance of local knowledge as a relevant information resource for ecosystem conditions has recently been the focus of sustainable ecosystem management. However, the accuracy of economic evaluation based on local knowledge regarding ecosystems has not yet been discussed, despite most activities in human society, including ecological conservation, being monetarily mediated. This study reports the correspondence between the economic value estimated by the fisher community and the analyzed environmental factors in the marine areas sectioned for oyster farming in Japan. At the study site, community-agreed usage fees for the area sections showed a gradient from the inner to the outer part of the bay. Our numerical modeling showed that the gradient of the economic value correlated with oyster feeding efficiency, indicating that a better location for feeding was empirically evaluated at a high price by the local fisher community. This suggests that the economic evaluation based on the local knowledge was biologically reasonable and could be a reliable information source for the aim of the area use in the study site.

691,Fishery resources trends and community-based management approaches adopted in the river Titas in Bangladesh,"During 1997-2002, a Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) project was implemented to monitor fish catches in two sections of the River Titas (Goshipur to Gokornaghat section and Ka section), an important tributary of the Meghna River in Bangladesh and the lower Indo-Gangetic Plains. The study covered fishing activities, fisher's participation in managing fishery resources, gear-diversification, changes in fishing patterns, and overall catch and effort. Fish catch monitoring results showed that production and species diversity increased over the duration of the project, due to the community management approach, which encourages participation of fishers, beneficiaries and communities in managing the renewable fishery resources. The study revealed that during 1997 to 2002 annual fish production increased by 233% and 15% in the two river sections, respectively. Overall species diversity increased by 30% in the river in 2002 compared to the baseline composition.

692,The impact of co-management on household income and expenditure: An empirical analysis of common property fishery resource management in Bangladesh,"Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM), or co-management, emerged in Bangladesh as an alternative arrangement for the management of water bodies to solve the adverse effects of the government leasing policy on fishers and fishery resources. As a result of the continuation of the traditional leasing system, the elites and influential individuals captured and controlled the water bodies, and, as a consequence, low income individual lost their rights to fish and work in these water bodies. In 1995, the Bangladesh Department of Fisheries initiated a new management system called CBFM where local poor people were involved in the management process and received rights to fish in the common property water bodies. This study examined the impact of the CBFM-2 project on the income, expenditure and inequality of the fishing community and determines the relationship between poverty and inequality. Following simple random sampling, a representative sample of 196 fisher households comprising 101 CBFM (target) fishers and 95 non-CBFM (control) fishers were selected from Hakaluki and Halir haors of the Moulouvibazer and Sunamgonj districts, respectively. A propensity score matching method was used for impact evaluation. The results show that the CBFM-2 project has a positive and significant impact on fisher's income and household expenditure when poor fishers are involved in the co-management system. The results also reveal that inequality is not a major problem in the study areas, and no significant changes in the income and expenditure distribution has taken place following the project implementation. Finally, the results reveal that inequality and poverty are negatively related in the study area.

693,Development of a surveillance species list to inform aquatic invasive species management in the laurentian great lakes,"In an effort to harmonize multi-jurisdictional surveillance and detection of aquatic invasive species, regional stakeholders have called for the development of a Great Lakes Aquatic Invasive Species Surveillance Framework to identify species that pose a risk to the basin, quantify the relative risk of various pathways of introduction, provide guidance on monitoring protocols for surveillance, and identify priority locations for surveillance based on this pathway assessment. Here, we screen 448 species to develop a surveillance list of 144 species that are relevant for Great Lakes surveillance: are not yet widespread throughout the basin, have a pathway through which they can arrive, are able to establish and are predicted to cause impacts. Using the Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Risk Assessment for consistent assessment across taxa, the surveillance species list consisted of 144 species: 64 plants, 4 algae, 40 fish, 5 mollusks, 28 crustaceans, 1 platyhelminthes and 2 bryozoans. While pathway risk varies by taxon, the highest risk pathways across all taxonomic groups are natural dispersal, hitchhiking/fouling, and intentional release. The taxonomic group predicted to have the most severe impacts on a per species basis is algae, followed by mollusks, and plants. However, the large number of plant and fish species on the surveillance species list means that overall predicted impact (from a taxonomic perspective) is greatest from these two groups. We recommend ways that the surveillance list could be applied to improve aquatic invasive species management efforts: engage in community-based surveillance, inform taxonomic and species surveillance priorities, provide guidance on monitoring protocols for surveillance, quantify the relative risk of various pathways of introduction and identify priority locations for surveillance based on this pathway assessment.

694,Conservation and Preservation for Endangered Mangrove Species: Comprehensive Case Study of Swamp Forest on North Coast Area of Malaysia,"Mangrove forests are special type of coastal ecosystem characterized by their adaptations that enable plants to thrive in saline soil. Despite accounting for only about 1% of global forest coverage, mangroves are keystone ecosystems that provide a variety of critical ecological processes and environmental services. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in interest in mangrove biodiversity. The lack of community-based organizations (CBO) on the awareness of conservation has a direct negative impact on endangered species. The aim of this is to analyze the conservation and preservation for mangrove in north coast area of Malaysia. Qualitative method was used to collect and analyzed the data, and supported with observations. The findings showed that mangrove conservation project in Kilim and Acheh River rivers are participated by the different stakeholders such as local government units (LGU), NGOs (PiFWA and Koperasi Komuniti Kampung Kilim Langkawi Berhad and Koperasi Nelayan Sungai Kubang Badak Langkawi Berhad), as well as a local community composed of fishermen, gleaners and business operator (travel agent). Those stakeholders are playing different role depend on their capacities. This study proves that mangrove forests are important for coastal area in Malaysia, and conservation efforts are needed to protect it. This finding also can be applied in other area. The contribution and participation of all parties also need for any conservation activities.

695,Mekong River Fish Conservation Zones in southern Laos: Assessing effectiveness using local ecological knowledge,"Small-scale fisheries are important in Laos, where rural people heavily depend upon Mekong River and tributary fish stocks for their livelihoods. Increasing pressures from human exploitation and habitat disturbance, however, have raised serious concerns about the potential depletion of various species. This has led to the establishment of large numbers of Fish Conservation Zones (FCZs) or ""no-take"" fish sanctuaries in southern Laos based on a ""community-based fisheries co-management"" framework. This study uses the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers to assess the effectiveness of village-managed FCZs in enhancing fish stocks in the mainstream Mekong River in Khong District, Champasak Province. Focus group interviews about species that are believed to have benefited from different FCZs are compared with parameters such as FCZ area, age, depth, localized gradient, water velocity, and the presence of wetland forests nearby. The results suggest that no one aspect is likely to account for variations in fish stocks; rather, it is the interaction between numerous factors that has the largest impact. Secondly, the results indicate that microhabitat diversity and protection are critical for maintaining and enhancing Mekong fisheries. Deep-water pools are particularly important as dry season refuges for many fish species, and FCZ depth may be the single most important environmental factor affecting the success of FCZs in the Mekong River. FCZs have the most potential to benefit relatively sedentary species, but may also benefit highly migratory species, given the right conditions. This study shows that integrated approaches to stock assessment that employ LEK and scientific fisheries management have considerable potential for improving Mekong capture-fisheries management.

696,Implications of Community-Based Management of Marine Reserves in the Philippines for Reef Fish Communities and Biodiversity,"Overfishing and destructive fishing practices are major threats to marine biodiversity in the Philippines, where over 1.9 million small-scale fishers are supported by these biodiverse marine communities. Nearly 50% of all marine fish capture in the Philippines is from artisanal fisheries, with much of it not reported or under-reported. Marine reserves, where fishing is prohibited have been created in many local government units to help restore and preserve this biodiversity. The success of these marine reserves is still under serious debate with effective management still representing a significant challenge. The lack of a governance system to centrally managed marine reserves has resulted in non-governmental organizations developing community-based management schemes. Using independent fisheries data from RareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fish Forever program, we applied PERMANOVA, SIMPER and biodiversity index analyses to evaluate the community structure of reef fish in 20 sites within the Philippines. We analyzed the differences in fish assemblage inside and outside of these marine reserves, before and after community-based management had been implemented. We provide evidence that: (i) fish community structure changes within marine reserves after community-based management strategies are implemented; and (ii) community-based management of marine fisheries resources protects and promotes biodiversity inside, and in some cases, outside marine reserves. Variability across sites suggests that other social or ecological factors may be influencing the ability of marine reserves to fully protect biodiversity and marine resources. Small-scale fishers in the Philippines participate in mixed-catch harvests and depend on biodiversity and reef community structure for their livelihoods. Thus, this work has implications on how community-based management strategies for marine reserves and adjacent waters may be beneficial for the sustainability of small-scale fishers.

697,Deconstructing the reality of community-based management of marine resources in a small island context in Indonesia,"This study offers a detailed analysis of community-based management (CBM) in a small island in Indonesia. In the study site, area-specific stewardship for a marine territory was informally institutionalized and, in addition to state rules, locally devised rules based on informal agreements have emerged. Using multiple methods for the analysis of the perceptions of the local community, this research examines the actual impact of the different rules on the fishing patterns in that sea territory, and illuminates the rationales of the local population to engage (or not) in the community-based approach to manage the marine resources. The study shows that the CBM initiative has to be seen as part of a convoluted regulatory system that impacts the fishing behavior in the sea territory. A lack of official authority to formally develop and especially to locally enforce rules represents a key challenges for the CBM initiative. This is further complicated by severe coordination problems between the local community and higher level state actors. The study further shows that the motivation of the community members to engage in the enforcement of the informal rules is strongly based on short-term economic considerations. For rules that are perceived to have a strong impact on the individual fishing yields, the fear of potential short-term economic losses constitutes a particular success factor of the local initiative since it motivates the members of the community to enforce local rules, especially when outside fishers break the rules. Yet, if rule-breaking is not perceived to decrease individual fishing yield, or if benefits of the generated yields are shared with the community as a compensation mechanism, the motivation of the community members to engage in rule enforcement ceases.

698,Piloting participatory smartphone mapping of intertidal fishing grounds and resources in northern Mozambique: Opportunities and future directions,"The participation of local communities in marine resource management can contribute to the sustainability and longevity of marine resources across diverse coastal settings. In contexts where there are low levels of formal education and high levels of illiteracy, and where marine resource management is governed predominantly by customary management systems, the introduction of formal marine resource management can be challenging. Maps are often required as the basis for spatial marine management measures, effective spatially-explicit fisheries monitoring, and for formal support from fisheries authorities. Our research with local women reef gleaners of Cabo Delgado, in northern Mozambique, pilots the potential uses of smartphones and digital mapping as a tool to allow fishers to map these understudied intertidal fishing grounds, and to understand the ecological dynamics as well as social uses of the intertidal resources. Even though women are key food and income providers through intertidal resource gleaning in this area of Mozambique, they have limited roles in fisheries management decision making. Therefore, we developed a participatory approach to mapping that could act as an entry point for their involvement in the design of a spatial fisheries management plan and associated community monitoring. Fisherwomen were trained to use smartphones with CyberTracker software for mapping intertidal fishing grounds in their village, and the locations of intertidal resources most important to their livelihoods, including octopus, pen shells and oysters. Interviews and focus groups were conducted throughout the mapping process to ascertain women's use and interest in the technology. We conclude that community-based mapping through simple tools as developed in this research can help connect local community groups, bridge traditional and formal governance systems and provide a positive example of co-management in practice.

699,"Local ecological knowledge and institutional dynamics for ecosystem management: A study of Lake Racken watershed, Sweden","The sustainable use of resources requires that management practices and institutions take into account the dynamics of the ecosystem. In this paper, we explore the role of local ecological knowledge and show how it is used in management practices by a local fishing association in a contemporary rural Swedish community. We focus on the local management of crayfish, a common-pool resource, and also address the way crayfish management is linked to institutions at different levels of Swedish society. Methods from the social sciences were used for information gathering, and the results were analyzed within the framework of ecosystem management. We found that the practices of local fishing association resemble an ecosystem approach to crayfish management. Our results indicate that local users have substantial knowledge of resource and ecosystem dynamics from the level of the individual crayfish to that of the watershed, as reflected in a variety of interrelated management practices embedded in and influenced by institutions at several levels. We propose that this policy of monitoring at several levels simultaneously, together with the interpretation of a bundle of indicators and associated management responses, enhances the possibility of building ecological resilience into the watershed. Furthermore, we found that flexibility and adaptation are required to avoid command-and-control pathways of resource management. We were able to trace the development of the local fishing association as a response to crisis, followed by the creation of an opportunity for reorganization and the recognition of slow ecosystem structuring variables, and also to define the role of knowledgeable individuals in the whole process. We discuss the key roles of adaptive capacity, institutional learning, and institutional memory for successful ecosystem management and conclude that scientific adaptive management could benefit from a more explicit collaboration with flexible community-based systems of resource management for the implementation of policies as experiments.",NA,No,"The paper is based on a case study from Sweden, not from any of the specified Pacific Island nations."," No; The study is clearly identified as being conducted in Sweden, not any of the listed Pacific Island nations.

700,How do fishery resources enhance the development of coastal fishing communities: Lessons learned from a community-based sea farming project in Taiwan,"Taiwan government proposes a national level Coastal Blue Economy Growth (CBEG) program to promote ocean-linked industries based on the concept of sustainable development. Sea farming development is considered an important aspect that needs to be promoted for the CBEG program. Generally, sea farming relies on artificial technologies, environmental improvement and resource management to increase fishery resources and to enhance fisheries productivity. Developing sea farming could contribute to the transformation of capture fisheries; it integrates the concept of Blue Economy into sustainable economic development so as to improve economic activities in fishing communities. In line with this, the Taiwan government launched the Community-Based Sea Farming (CBSF) project in 2015. The CBSF project aims to establish sea farming zones to help fishing communities achieve sustainable development. In this paper, the development process of sea farming and site selection of the CBSF project were described and the needs of local people in fishing communities around sea-farming demonstration zones were also assessed. According to findings, a framework for sea farming development is proposed. In this framework, several new sea farming-based industries can serve as the driving force to accelerate the development of fishing communities. The driving forces include developing a community-based tourism recreational industry, strengthening localized marketing of featured seafood products, combining local ecological landscapes and cultures of the fishing village to develop recreational fishery activities, and integrating seafood products with recreational tourism activities. Overall, CBSF are important tasks that warrant continuous attention for enhancing the fishing community development.

This program focused on the implementation of best-practice in coastal resource management involving multiple local stakeholders. Fifteen years after its phase-out, a study was conducted on seagrass beds in Tumbak and Bentenan village in Pusomaen district to obtain the seagrass ecosystem's current status and condition in the former pilot sites. We observed the program's legacy in terms of community awareness concerning coastal resource management and seagrass ecosystem. A line transect method was used to assess species diversity, coverage, and dominance in 9 stations. Environmental variables (weather, human activities, depth, clarity) and communities' behavior towards seagrass beds (domestic waste disposal, boat anchoring) were also observed. The result showed that seven stations were in moderate, one in poor, and one in healthy conditions. There were seven seagrass species found during the observation. Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were found in all stations, dominating the seagrass coverage. We also recorded the presence of Syringodium isoetifolium and Cymodocea rotundata in several stations. The expected CB- CRMP legacies of institutionalized community-based coastal management were nearly non-existent, while negative or indifferent behavior of the general community towards the seagrass ecosystem was observed, highlighted by domestic waste disposal and boat anchoring in the seagrass beds. Consistency of program planning and financial support from local and provincial governments were needed to maintain the legacy of CB-CRMP, while regular ecosystem monitoring was also pivotal in providing scientific data for local and provincial decision-making processes regarding coastal resource management.

Together with an unmarked control group, marker retention and effects on shrimp' s survival and growth were monitored. There was no significant difference in specific CL growth rates among treatments (p>0.05). Survival was not significantly different among staining (60%), uropod trimming (51%), and control (58%) throughout the experiment, but T-bar tagging showed significantly lower survival from week 6 until 8 (33%) (p<0.05). Marker retention was significantly highest for T-bar tags (100%) at the end of 8 weeks, followed by uropod trimming at 65%, while staining was already 0% from week 3. Food color stains are poor shrimp markers because of weak retention. T-bar tags are not effective markers despite having excellent tag retention because of low shrimp survival after 6 weeks. Uropod trimming is a more practical option given that shrimps showed comparable survival with the control group and marker distinction through unique uropod regrowth was relatively high. Further work on modifications on these methods is needed to increase efficiency while maintaining lower cost.

Conservation non-governmental organizations (NGOs), noting the remarkable biodiversity and increasing threats due to destructive fishing practices, worked with local communities to facilitate community-based MPAs as a conservation strategy. Here we employed a case study approach to assess the specific bridging strategies utilized by NGOs during the adoption, implementation and management of the Raja Ampat MPA Network. This descriptive case study included six targeted in-depth interviews and other secondary sources. Our results suggest that NGOs played different roles over time in the MPA process. Interviewees identified specific initiatives that occurred during this process, which involved multiple bridging tools. Three of these key initiatives are: the Tourism Entrance Fee System, the Raja Ampat MPA Patrol System, and the Blue Abadi Fund. The specific bridging tools employed included: linking stakeholders, co-producing knowledge, providing access to resources, facilitating community engagement, and building capacity. Recent research has pointed to social and ecological effectiveness of the Raja Ampat MPA Network, which could in part be attributed to the bottom-up approach facilitated by NGOs, including through bridging practices. However, we also note the limitations of this study in only providing an NGO-centric perspective which may be more nuanced if other stakeholder perspectives could have been obtained.

704,An empirical bio-economic stocking model for floodplain beels in Bangladesh,"While stocking floodplain depressions or beels with fingerlings is a common form of fisheries management in Bangladesh, bio-economic guidance for improving the outcome of stocking strategies is sparse. The Community-Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) Project, funded by the Ford Foundation and the UK Government's Department for International Development (DfID) promoted stocking practices in beels throughout the country as a means to improve fisher livelihoods. This paper describes an empirical bio-economic model developed using data generated under the CBFM project. The model offers guidance on selecting stocking densities depending upon the available size (length) of fingerlings to maximize profit and return on investment while minimizing risk. Because large fingerlings are relatively inexpensive and have lower rates of natural mortality, the model predicts that it is more profitable to stock large fingerlings at low densities than small fingerlings at high densities. These general recommendations were found to be largely insensitive to the market price for harvested fish. To minimize credit burden and financial risk, minimum stocking densities should be selected according to the length of fish available that maximizes profit. Because of its empirical nature, the model recommendations may not be applicable beyond the project sites. Furthermore, it is recommended that attempts be made to field test the model predictions before widespread adoption or promotion.

705,"Effects of fisheries closure size, age, and history of compliance on coral reef fish communities in the western Indian Ocean","The hypothesis that the history of management compliance (strong versus variable), closure size (0.3 to 28km2), closure age (2 to 39 yr), and habitat/geographic variables influenced total fish biomass, the number of species, and the ratio of herbivores to carnivores in no-take areas was tested. Twenty existing closures across 6 countries in the western Indian Ocean were sampled during the same time period (2004 to 2007). Geographic location and closure attributes were weak to moderate predictors of these coral reef fish community variables for analyses of all closures. Strong interactions between fish community variables and levels of compliance indicated that high compliance sites largely drove the closure-fish community relationships. Variable or weak compliance and closures &lt;1km2 exhibited limited recovery of fish communities. The closure area-fish biomass data for strong-compliance closures indicates that biomass is stable above 5km2. A mix of community-based, private, and national program closures were sampled, and, although low sample sizes within each of these management systems precludes conclusive analysis, none of these management systems was universally successful in terms of compliance or maximizing fish community variables.

706,Improving asthma control in the rural setting: The BREATHE (Better Respiratory Education and Asthma Treatment in Hinton and Edson) study,"Background: Overuse of ÃŽÂ²-agonists is a risk factor for poor control of asthma. Pharmacists can identify high-risk patients through refill information and can then initiate disease-management programs for these patients. Methods: The Better Respiratory Education and Asthma Treatment in Hinton and Edson (BREATHE) study was a randomized, controlled trial in high-risk asthma patients. The intervention included an educational program (with focus on development of a written action plan), assessment of asthma therapy, and referral to a respiratory therapist and primary care physician. The primary objective was to determine the effect of this program (initiated by community pharmacists) on asthma control, as measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire. Secondary objectives included determining the effect of the program on numbers of emergency department visits and hospital admissions, use of inhaled corticosteroids, courses of oral steroids, and lung function. Endpoints were measured at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months. Results: A total of 70 patients were randomized (34 to usual care, 36 to the intervention). At 6 months, there was no significant difference in asthma control between the usual care and intervention groups (change in ACQ score 0.33 and 0.43 respectively, p = 0.66). There were no significant differences in the secondary endpoints. Generally, pharmacist compliance with the intervention was poor.

707,Rapid implementation of evidence-based guidelines for imaging after first urinary tract infection,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The American Academy of Pediatrics published a new guideline for management of first urinary tract infection (UTI) in children aged 2 to 24 months in September 2011. The imaging evaluation changed from the previous guideline to recommend voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) only for patients with an abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS). The objective was to decrease the proportion of guideline-eligible children with a normal RBUS who underwent VCUG from median of 92% for patients treated as inpatients and 100% for patients treated in the emergency department to 5% in both settings. METHODS: This was a quality improvement implementation study in a large academic medical center. Key drivers included: appropriate guideline knowledge, timely identification of guideline eligible patients, and effective communication with the community-based primary care provider. A multidisciplinary team developed and tested interventions. Impact was assessed with annotated run charts. Statistical comparisons were made with Ãâ€¡2 analysis and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The proportion of children with first UTI and normal RBUS who underwent VCUG decreased from a median of 92% to 0% within 1 month of initiating the project among those hospitalized and from 100% to 40% within 4 months among those diagnosed in the emergency department. Rates have been sustained for 12 months and 8 months, respectively. Interventions using the electronic medical record and ordering system were most impactful. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid adoption of evidence-based UTI care across multiple settings is achievable. Practice change occurred faster and to a greater magnitude in the inpatient setting compared with the outpatient setting.

709,Challenges facing local communities in Tanzania in realising locally-managed marine areas,"This study explores how the history and process of establishing a marine protected area (MPA) under the control of the state has led to limited interest in community-based management amongst local stakeholders. The study contributes to the understanding of historical events that have discouraged the take-off and scale-up of community-based conservation approaches, such as locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs). LMMAs are being promoted increasingly as a desirable approach in marine conservation. However, there are a limited numbers of cases where such initiatives have been used as a strategy for marine management in sub-Saharan Africa, and very few operational examples of such schemes exist in the Western Indian Ocean region. Through semi-structured questionnaires, 193 community members selected randomly from 15 villages of the Mnazi Bay-Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park (MBREMP), Mtwara district, Southern Tanzania, were interviewed about their attitudes towards efforts to promote local management and the conservation of marine resources. The study also involved 17 focus group discussions, 13 in-depth key informant interviews, participant observation, and a review of secondary information. Over 85% of the questionnaire respondents commented that there was insufficient participation by legitimate community representatives in the development of the MBREMP. Almost 90% of the respondents agreed that the management of marine areas has increased significantly, particularly in the last two decades following initiatives by the government, donors and external NGOs. However, 70% of the questionnaire responders had observed that a rapid shift from centralised to community-based management has been hindered by a lack of acceptable community rules and by communities frequently equating conservation with prohibition. Developing LMMAs in areas based on the lessons learned from MPAs could be a better alternative to developing entirely new community-managed areas; however, this can only succeed if limitations including the key principles of community participation and empowerment are addressed.

710,Fostering social innovation and building adaptive capacity for dengue control in Cambodia: A case study,"Background: The social-ecological systems theory, with its unique conception of resilience (social-ecological systems & resilience, SESR), provides an operational framework that currently best meets the need for integration and adaptive governance as encouraged by the Sustainable Development Goals. SESR accounts for the complex dynamics of social-ecological systems and operationalizes transdisciplinarity by focusing on community engagement, value co-creation, decentralized leadership and social innovation. Targeting Social Innovation (SI) in the context of implementation research for vector-borne diseases (VBD) control offers a low-cost strategy to contribute to lasting and contextualized community engagement in disease control and health development in low and middle income countries of the global south. In this article we describe the processes of community engagement and transdisciplinary collaboration underpinning community-based dengue management in rural primary schools and households in two districts in Cambodia. Methods: Multiple student-led and community-based interventions have been implemented focusing on empowering education, communication for behavioral change and participatory epidemiology mapping in order to engage Cambodian communities in dengue control. We describe in particular the significance of the participatory processes that have contributed to the design of SI products that emerged following iterative consultations with community stakeholders to address the dengue problem. Results: The SI products that emerged following our interaction with community members are 1) adult mosquito traps made locally from solid waste collections, 2) revised dengue curriculum with hands-on activities for transformative learning, 3) guppy distribution systems led by community members, 4) co-design of dengue prevention communication material by students and community members, 5) community mapping. Conclusions: The initiative described in this article put in motion processes of community engagement towards creating ownership of dengue control interventions tools by community stakeholders, including school children. While the project is ongoing, the project's interventions so far implemented have contributed to the emergence of culturally relevant SI products and provided initial clues regarding 1) the conditions allowing SI to emerge, 2) specific mechanisms by which it happens and 3) how external parties can facilitate SI emergence. Overall there seems to be a strong argument to be made in supporting SI as a desirable outcome of project implementation towards building adaptive capacity and resilience and to use the protocol supporting this project implementation as an operational guiding document for other VBD adaptive management in the region.

711,Decentralization policy: An opportunity for strengthening fisheries management system?,"Decentralization is considered the most appropriate form of fisheries governance in which to enable local governments to fundamentally control local fishing by a community-based fisheries management (CBFM) system. The CBFM systems in Indonesia were established and rooted in traditional fishing communities. Nevertheless, the role of these systems has been somewhat undermined by the central government because political decision states that marine areas must be nationally owned. In the decentralization era, however, these traditional systems may be reconsidered as the main social and cultural capital of fisheries management, particularly for coastal fisheries. Based on a case study in Lombok Barat, this article reveals some positive impacts of decentralization policy: state recognition to CBFM systems, devolution of fisheries management to the local people, and strengthening of CBFM systems. These impacts show that decentralization can be an external factor for strengthening the CBFM system.

712,'Going rural': Driving change through a rural medical education innovation,"Introduction: Medical education across the globe is in a state of flux influenced by a number of drivers for change. In response, institutions are seeking to re-align their curricula to address the prevailing imperatives. Against this backdrop, the training of practitioners for practice in rural communities was identified as an educational priority, and led to the establishment of a rural clinical school (RCS) within a Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences in South Africa in 2011. This article describes the students' experiences in the first year that this innovative educational model was implemented and explores the extent to which it influenced their thinking and practice. Methods: A qualitative, formative evaluation study of the first year of implementation was undertaken. Data was generated from in-depth interviews. This article focuses on individual interviews conducted with the eight students at the RCS, which explored their experiences during a year-long clerkship. Transcripts of interviews were thematically analysed. Results: Four themes emerged from the analysis: a learning experience that differed from what was experienced at the tertiary training hospital, an enabling clinical environment in the district and regional hospital, the positive role played by the specialists, and the influence of the community immersion. Underlying all of the responses was the building of relationships over time both with supervisors and with patients. Evident from the responses was that students' confidence in their clinical skills and decision-making abilities was heightened while their approaches to their own learning were enhanced. Conclusions: To respond to the call for educational reform and a heightened awareness of social realities, innovative approaches to the training of medical students, such as those adopted at the RCS, are indicated. It is argued that the learning facilitated by these rural medical education models has the potential to offer learning experiences that can lead to transformation through a change in practice and attitude among the students, and ultimately also enable curricular renewal at the institutional core.

713,"Spawning and recruitment patterns of major fish species in Bontanga Reservoir, Ghana, West Africa","The spawning and recruitment patterns of the major Cichlid fish species, including Hemichromis fasciatus, Oreochromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia zillii and other species, Auchenoglanis occidentalis, Brycinus nurse, Clarias gariepinus and Marcusenius senegalensis were studied for 24 months in Bontanga Reservoir, Ghana, using length-based fish stock assessment approaches. The species spawned throughout the year, with two spawning pulses described as major and minor spawning seasons. The major spawning season occurred from March to September for the Cichlids, and from May to September for the other species. The minor spawning season, indicative of extended spawning, occurred from October to March for all the fish stocks. Fish spawning began with the onset of the rains in April/May, peaking by June/July, before the rainfall peak in August for all the fish stocks studied. Recruitment was found to occur throughout the year, with major and minor pulses coinciding with the major and minor spawning seasons. Accordingly, the most appropriate time for a possible closed fishing period appears to be from June to August, 1 month after the start of, and before the end of, the rains. The estimated mean standard length (Lm) for first time spawners of A. occidentalis, B. nurse, C. gariepinus and H. faciatus were 11.7, 12.7, 2.7 and 7.5 cm respectively. The estimated maturity-length ratio of 0.4 and 0.2 for O. niloticus, S. galilaeus and T. zillii were lower than the known 0.7 for normal growth, suggesting the tilapias matured faster, and at a smaller size, in the reservoir. Apparent sexual precocity associated with early maturity, year-round spawning and recruitment were some important adaptations found to have sustained the reservoir fisheries, even during high fishing pressures. For conservation and sustainable exploitation of the fisheries, instituting a closed fishing season, mesh size regulations, withdrawal rights and a community-based fishery management system are recommended.

715,Can botanic gardens serve as refuges for taxonomic and functional diversity of Odonata? The case of the botanic garden of CastillaÃ¢â‚¬â€œLa Mancha (Spain),"In a scenario with declining biodiversity and habitat loss, botanic gardens could serve as refuges for invertebrates, but the opportunities they offer for animal conservation are still poorly understood. Odonata is a good model group for conservation studies, because it includes threatened species and responses to habitat disturbance are well documented. In this study, we assessed the role of the botanic garden of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain as a refuge for members of Odonata by analysing their taxonomic and functional diversity. We explored if the small size of the botanic garden might constrain the taxonomic diversity of Odonata and if low habitat diversity might limit their functional diversity. We sampled adult Odonata from five water bodies along a gradient of human impact and characterized the Odonata communities based on 12 functional traits in Odonata. We used a speciesÃ¢â‚¬â€œarea relationship to control for differences in the size of water bodies. Compared with natural lakes, the Odonata communities contained less species and their functional diversity was lower in the botanic garden ponds, where generalist species were basically hosted. Despite these limitations, the botanic garden ponds hosted the number of species expected for natural water bodies with the moderate surface area and functional diversity, thereby demonstrating that they are a valuable habitat for Odonata in an urban environment. Appropriate management involving the removal of exotic fish and habitat diversification, including creating lotic environments, would increase the taxonomic and functional diversity of Odonata in this urban system.

716,Formal versus informal institutions: Extraction and earnings in framed field experiments with small-scale fishing communities in Turkey,"Although many formal and informal mechanisms have been proposed to avoid over-fishing, their relative effectiveness is relatively understudied. This paper investigates fisher behaviour subject to formal and informal institutions in an experimental field setting. Framed field experiments were conducted with 240 fishers to assess cooperation and compare the effectiveness of formal and informal institutions for small-scale fishers in Turkey. Turkish fisheries is characterized mainly as open-access, subject to immense competition between industrial, small-scale and recreational fishers, even though formal measures such as closed seasons and areas are prevalent. Extraction and earnings were measured under two formal institutions (monetary penalty versus purchase of fishing rights for every unit of catch beyond the quota) and were compared to an informal mechanism involving communication as well as a baseline representing open-access. While monetary penalty was effective to reduce extraction relative to baseline (open-access), the other formal institution, purchase of fishing rights, did not significantly reduce extraction, even though providing the same level of economic incentive. Communication was the most effective to increase earnings and improve income equality. This result supports the argument that community-based institutions and co-management in fisheries management (entailing communication) can improve sustainable resource use and livelihoods of small-scale fishers in developing countries. The results suggest that differently framed economic incentives may lead to differential outcomes in terms of cooperation, earnings and income distribution. These findings contribute to fisheries management in addressing unintended fisher behaviour, as well as to other sustainability policies in dealing with resource use conflicts in general.

717,Emergence and diversity of marine protected areas in Madagascar,"The protection of marine biodiversity is considered a global priority, as exemplified in the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi targets and in Sustainable Development Goal 14. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered to be effective conservation and fisheries management tools that generate various ecological and social-economic benefits. MPAs come in all types and sizes, and are managed following different principles, users' needs, and preferences. Madagascar's unique marine biodiversity is currently protected under a range of MPA regimes that emerged comparatively recently, long after the terrestrial protected areas. This study describes the historical outline of the MPA development process in Madagascar, and proposes inputs for the future management of MPAs. A policy arrangement approach to structure an iterative Delphi survey was used to analyse how discourse, actors, rules and resources have shaped MPA development in Madagascar. The findings suggest that international initiatives and funding have played a key role in the early days of MPA emergence, while currently co-management between governmental and non-governmental actors shows mixed results regarding conservation effectiveness. Challenges include a better coordination of efforts among various stakeholders, granting a large responsibility to local communities, e.g. in the successful locally managed marine areas (LMMAs), and integrating customary law into the set of regulations for marine conservation and sustainable management in Madagascar.

719,A community-based approach to solid waste management for riverine and coastal resource sustainability in the Philippines,"Improper solid waste management practices are harmful to riverine and coastal ecosystems. In the Philippines, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (Republic Act No. 9003) decentralized the management structure and mandated Local Government Units (LGUs) to adopt new integrated solid waste management (SWM) plans. However, LGUs often lack the capacity, understanding, and enforcement authority for effective SWM. With minimal SWM awareness leading to socio-economic and environmental problems, alternative management approaches may be effective. This paper discusses the creation and implementation of a community-based program to educate community members and develop sustainable initiatives to improve SWM practices that have been observed to affect riverine and coastal environments in Tabaco City, Albay, Philippines. The Save the Rivers, Save the Sea program was designed as a way to engage students and local youth in environmental issues in their communities. The program's first year mobilized a team of students and collected data from a community needs assessment, water quality analyses, and workshops, which we utilized to create a sustainable action plan for the remainder of the program. The action plan provides the program with goals and objectives in order to affect SWM change in Tabaco City's rivers and coastal environments. First-year program and observational findings demonstrated that community-based programs are effective tools for addressing SWM challenges but, to be sustainable, need to co-exist with a supportive and committed LGU.

720,Watershed restoration as a tool for improving coral reef resilience against climate change and other human impacts,"Environmental stressors in coastal areas threaten the sustainability of marine resources and reduce their resilience to climate change impacts. Accelerated land erosion is a major stressor that leads to increased turbidity and sedimentation on downstream coral reefs and the degradation of ecosystem functions. Volunteers from a community-based initiative in Guam installed 130 tree seedlings and 54 m of sediment filter socks in eroding hillsides above Fouha Bay, to reduce erosion. A soil probing method for measuring soil depth was developed and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the watershed restoration tools. The trees and socks trapped 111.8 tons of sediment on land after 21 months. In heavily eroding portions of the restoration plot, where socks and trees were used in combination, the mean sediment trapping efficiency was 44 kg mÃ¢Ë†â€™2 yrÃ¢Ë†â€™1. Previous studies indicate a 75% reduction in sedimentation rate is required to bring Fouha Bay below severe-catastrophic sedimentation stress (&gt;50 mg cmÃ¢Ë†â€™2 dayÃ¢Ë†â€™1). Based on the observed sediment trapping efficiency of restoration tools in this study, an estimated 0.05 km2 of severely eroding hillsides must be treated with 19 km of socks and 11,000 trees to trap 2121 tons of sediment and achieve the necessary reduction. If sediment input into the bay is controlled, existing sediment will clear out with storm-driven swells. As shown in other high islands, coral reefs are resilient and can recover after sedimentation stress is reduced. Data generated on the efficiency of watershed restoration tools in this study can be used in watershed management plans to promote the sustainability and resilience of coastal areas in other tropical islands.

A new local ecological knowledge dataset was obtained through large-scale questionnaire-based interviews with 510 artisanal fishers from 16 coastal fishing communities around Hainan, China. Almost all respondents (92.7%) reported regular encounters with marine mammals. Many respondents reported negative interactions with marine mammals, including bycatch (25.5%), consumption (36.1%), and the sale of meat (9.2%), and respondent perceptions of marine mammals were often negative. Generalized linear models (GLMs) indicated that respondent experiences of marine mammal encounters and bycatch events were mainly predicted by indices of fishing effort and experience, rather than by geographic or socio-economic factors. Respondent experiences of eating or selling marine mammal meat were predicted by geographic location and by some livelihood and socio-economic factors. Respondent perceptions of marine mammals were instead predicted by fishing experience and education level. Classification and regression trees (CARTs) showed that the most important factors determining respondent experiences and perceptions were number of fishing years and educational level, respectively. Both GLMs and CARTs indicated the complex effects of geographic, livelihood, and socio-economic factors on respondent experiences and perceptions of marine mammals. Regional community-based conservation of marine mammals could be promoted through improved regulatory management and environmental education, sustainable ecological exploitation and economic development, and positive partnerships and collaboration between fishing communities, enforcement agencies, and researchers.

722,Vulnerable WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Perceptions of Individual Versus Group Prenatal Care: Results of a Cross-Sectional Survey,"Introduction Vulnerable pregnant women (e.g. women with low socio-economic status or recent immigrants) are less likely to receive adequate prenatal care or to attend perinatal education classes. CenteringPregnancy (CP) is a model of group prenatal care which combines assessment, education and support. This study aimed to assess patient experience among vulnerable women in group prenatal care compared to individual care. Methods Women participating in CP at a community-based health centre in urban Alberta were eligible to participate. A convenience sample of women who received individual care at a low-risk maternity clinic served as comparison. Women were asked a series of questions on their prenatal care experience. Demographic and patient responses were compared using Chi square, fisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact and t tests. Results Forty-five women accessing CP and 92 women accessing individual care participated. Women in CP were younger, more likely to be single and having their first baby than women in individual care. Women in CP were significantly more likely to report having received enough information on exercise during pregnancy (92 vs. 66%, p = 0.002), breastfeeding (95 vs. 70%, p = 0.002) and baby care (95 vs. 67%, p = 0.001). Women in CP were more likely to report that they felt their prenatal care providers were interested in how the pregnancy was affecting their life (100 vs. 93%, p Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001). Discussion Group prenatal care provides a positive experience and improved information exchange among vulnerable populations. Programs interested in engaging, educating and empowering vulnerable pregnant women may benefit from implementation of group care.

723,Acceptability of territorial use rights in fisheries: towards community-based management of small-scale fisheries in the Philippines,"The granting of territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) to fisherfolk associations, similar to that practiced in Japan, is recommended as a management tool for small-scale fisheries in the Philippines. This study, carried out to determine the acceptability of the practice under Philippine conditions, was conducted among 211 coastal dwellers of five municipalities in Panay Island, Central Philippines. Respondents of the survey generally perceived the practice of TURFs as acceptable as it would lead to an improvement of their catch. Results suggest that the respondents' present predicament of inadequacy of catch to support their livelihood is the starting point for introduction of the rationale for community-based management of coastal marine resources.

724,"Village level institutions at the margins of natural resource management: The case of vdcs in Ngamiland, Botswana","Institutions exercise authority through rules and regulations that determine who is eligible for what and how. In Botswana the institutional landscape consists of the public sector, private enterprises, non-government and community based organisations. These institutions affect people's pursuance of natural resource-based livelihoods activities such as those related to access to water, land, veldt products, fish, wildlife, grazing grounds, grass thatch and reeds. Informal and formal village level institutions (VLIs) in contemporary Botswana are increasingly becoming important ""bridging institutions"" mediating access to resources and opportunities between public and private sectors. This chapter uses a case study of Village Development Committees (VDCs) in Ngamiland District in northwestern Botswana to assess the extent to which they mediate access to a range of resources especially in rural and remote areas. VDCs in Ngamiland tend to be multipurpose institutions adapting to the emerging challenges of a changing society. Although they are a nonstatutory institution, and have no mandate to determine who has access and control over natural resources, VDCs play an indirect advocacy role for the provision of water, facilitate diversification of the local economy, and promote natural resources conservation, good solid waste disposal practices and buffer between top and down decision-making. The extent to which they are able to advocate for resource access effectively depends on the existence of other supportive or complementary resource systems both at local and district levels.

726,"This is no longer a Bristol Bay FisheryÃ¢â‚¬Â: Fisheries dispossession and colonial violence in Bristol Bay, Alaska","Throughout Alaska, Indigenous fishing communities have been disproportionately and negatively impacted by policies that privatize access rights to the commercial fisheries. While the deleterious impacts of fisheries privatization on Alaska Native and rural AlaskansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cultural lifeways, family systems, household economies, and community health have been extensively documented, the ways in which the dispossession of commercial fishing rights has contributed to colonial violence is less understood. Drawing on a community-based participatory study examining the colonial roots of sexual and domestic violence in Bristol Bay, Alaska, this paper explores Alaska Native survivorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experiences with the shifts in commercial fisheries management systems, their perspectives of cultural and community changes brought on by fisheries privatization, and connection between those changes and colonial violence. The findings show that privatization processesÃ¢â‚¬â€which have been commonly heralded as an economic and environmental solution to fisheries managementÃ¢â‚¬â€have profound socio-cultural effects that contribute to broader social ills of violence against women and substance abuse that are endemic to many of Alaska's rural hubs and villages.

727,"Effects of habitat, wave exposure, and marine protected area status on coral reef fish assemblages in the Hawaiian archipelago","The relationships between fish assemblages, their associated habitat, and degree of protection from fishing were evaluated over a broad spatial scale throughout the main Hawaiian islands. Most fish assemblage characteristics showed positive responses to protection whether it was physical (e.g. habitat complexity), biological (e.g. coral cover growth forms), or human-induced (e.g. marine reserves). Fish biomass was lowest in areas of direct wave exposure and highest in areas partially sheltered from swells. Higher values for fish species richness, number of individuals, biomass, and diversity were observed in locations with higher substrate complexity. Areas completely protected from fishing had distinct fish assemblages with higher standing stock and diversity than areas where fishing was permitted or areas that were partially protected from fishing. Locations influenced by customary stewardship harbored fish biomass that was equal to or greater than that of no-take protected areas.

728,Small no-take areas benefit hard corals more than regulation through fishing permits,"Situated in the coral triangle, the Philippines hosts some of the world's most diverse coral reefs. Yet there are few national marine protected areas (MPAs) in place that coincide with these reefs. Municipal MPAs partially alleviate this issue but a controlled comparison of the effects of different small-scale management strategies on coral reefs is lacking. Danjugan Island Marine Reserve and Sanctuaries (DIMRS) is one of these community-based MPAs that encompasses a collection of small (0.3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.34Ã‚Â km2) marine reserves situated in a larger MPA where fishing is regulated through permits. The unique juxtaposition of different management strategies within DIMRS was used as a model system to test whether reserves are better for corals than limited fishing permits by comparing ecosystem indicators (coral cover, bleaching, disease, and morphological diversity). Total and live hard corals were 169% and 204% more abundant inside than outside no-take zones in 2016. This distinction increased between 2002 and 2016 as a result of a more marked decrease in coral cover over time in the partially protected zones. A 70% higher coral community evenness outside the reserves further suggests that scleractinian coral communities on fished reefs are more disturbed. Live coral cover within the MPAs of DIMRS in 2016 (39Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4%) is above the current mean for Philippine reefs (23%) and is comparable with the long-term average for reefs situated within Philippine MPAs (36%).

729,"Halfway to sustainability: Management lessons from community-based, marine no-take zones in the Mexican Caribbean","Spatial closure regimes such as marine protected areas (MPAs) have emerged as a prominent tool in the effort to balance ecosystem health and fishery productivity. As MPAs have proliferated, the conservation community has begun to supplement traditional biological metrics with social and community considerations in the way it seeks to manage and evaluate such tools. To assess management outcomes and opportunities for a network of community-based, marine no-take zones (NTZs) in the Mexican Caribbean, semi-structured interviews were carried out with fishers and key management stakeholders. Findings indicate that the community-based management strategy has inherent tradeoffs between community engagement and conservation potential. Managers have succeeded in fostering high levels of community support for the initiative, but significant challenges remain, most notably the high presence of illegal fishing within NTZs. Successes and challenges of the community-based management strategy are documented and evaluated within a fisheries resource management framework. As the NTZ network undergoes legal renovation following the completion of its initial five-year term, this work serves as an important resource for both reflection on, and adaptation of, the community-based NTZ management regime.

730,Methods of consensus building for community-based fisheries management in Bangladesh and the Mekong Delta,"A method of consensus building for management of wetlands and fisheries using a systematic approach to participatory planning and initially developed in Bangladesh is now being applied in both Bangladesh and the Mekong delta. The method recognizes diversity in livelihoods and works through a structured learning and planning process that focuses on common interests. It works with each category of stakeholder separately to prioritize the natural resource problems that their livelihoods are largely dependent on; they then share and agree common priorities in plenary. Then the stakeholder groups separately analyze possible solutions and their impacts, before meeting in plenary to share their analysis and form a consensus on win-win solutions. The process identifies the collective actions that are needed to arrive at preferred solutions, and determines potential impacts on different stakeholders and responsibilities for implementation, monitoring and evaluation. We outline the process in the context of building social capital through consensus, and compare indicators of social capital as an outcome of its application in a Vietnamese village in the Mekong delta with the outcomes of a similar process in a floodplain wetland in Bangladesh.

731,A rapid appraisal approach to evaluation of community-level fisheries management systems: Framework and field application at selected coastal fishing villages in the philippines and indonesia,"Among the recent attempts to use Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques traditionally employed in agriculture and other terrestrial resource systems is in the evaluation of the coastal and marine fisheries environments. One of these approaches is called Rapid Appraisal of Fisheries Management Systems (RAFMS). which was developed at the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM). The RAFMS is a diagnostic tool designed to quickly document and evaluate the operating fisheries management systems, both formally and informally, at the community level. As a critical first step in diagnosing the existing types of community-level fisheries management systems, the RAFMS shall provide general information on their essential features, operations, and impacts. Given limited funds, time, and research personnel, it is not always possible to conduct in-depth studies of community based fisheries resource management systems at a specific site or across a country. While the RAFMS is no substitute for more detailed studies, it can provide cost-effective information, and a research or policy direction for further study. This paper first describes the framework of the RAFMS. It then provides examples of output from RAFMS generated through field applications in the fishing villages of Ulugan Bay and Binunsalian Bay at Palawan Island, the Philippines, and Nolloth Village at Saparua Island, Indonesia. The RAFMS was found useful in generating information for outside experts, local researchers, and residents of the fishing communities.

732,Social finance and the commons paradigm: Exploring how community-based innovations transform finance for the common good,"Purpose: The concept of the commons, or common goods, is becoming increasingly widespread in the world of research and among civil society. The commons are defined as resources that are shared and collectively managed by communities of users, such as natural commons (e.g. fisheries, the climate) and knowledge commons (e.g. Wikipedia, open-source software). The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents the findings of the PhD dissertation Ã¢â‚¬Å“Social finance and the commons,Ã¢â‚¬Â recipient of the 2017 Emerald/EFMD Outstanding Doctoral Research Award, category Management and Governance, sponsored by Management Decision. Adopting an interdisciplinary perspective of the commons, this dissertation investigates how community enterprises govern financial resources as commons to serve the common good. To do so, it builds on data collected on community development banks in Brazil and complementary currencies in multiple countries. Findings: The findings explain how collective action favors the implementation of new forms of governance and management potentially enabling finance to create and support communities. In doing so, this dissertation provides insights on the transformative power of some governance features for the creation of commons. Originality/value: This dissertation advances theoretical and conceptual foundations for a theory of the commons in management sciences. It contributes to a new conceptualization of the commons, especially by extending the concept of commons to finance and showing the variety of commons according to governance structures and values. It also generates theoretical insights into social and community entrepreneurship research through an in-depth investigation of social finance organizations.

734,Spring habitats of small pelagic fish communities in the Bay of Biscay,"Mapping habitats of species communities helps to inform on the ecological processes which drive their distribution. This information is critical to identify suitable areas for spatial management, aimed at preserving biodiversity, ecosystem functions or essential habitats. While demersal fish have been extensively studied at the community scale, small pelagic fish have mainly been characterised at the population scale. This paper presents a community-based approach on the biodiversity of small pelagic fish, with the aim to: (i) define small pelagic fish communities, (ii) characterise their spatial and interannual dynamics, and (iii) assess their habitats. We present a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)-based method that characterises the spatio-temporal variability in a series of multivariate maps. The main components of variability in these maps are identified to define Ã¢â‚¬Å“characteristic areasÃ¢â‚¬Â displaying contrasting conditions in both MFA ordination and geographical spaces. Characteristic habitats of fish communities were defined by the correlation between the main components of variability from MFAs applied to maps containing fish information on one hand, and on hydrographic variables on the other hand. The analysis of the long term PELGAS survey series of fish biomass and hydrological indices maps resulted in the characterisation of mesoscale latitudinal gradients and coarse to mesoscale onshore-offshore gradients in both fish and hydrology datasets. A community with anchovy (E. encrasicolus) and chub mackerel (S. colias) as indicator species was consistently distributed in southeast Biscay. This area was associated with higher bottom temperatures, which likely affected the fish community through physiological processes. A second community with small clupeiforms as indicator species was found in coastal spawning habitats. These habitats were typically characterised by low salinity, a probable proxy for high productivity and good feeding grounds for those species. Mapping the habitats of small pelagic fish communities may inform marine spatial management, aimed at preserving biodiversity, ecosystem structure and function. In addition, it may help in achieving maximum sustainable yields of these commercially important species, and contribute to achieving and maintaining good environmental status of shelf seas ecosystems.

735,"Bridging the gap between gender and marine conservation: The case of calatagan mangrove forest conservation park in Batangas, Philippines","Philippines sits on a global hotspot where the epicenter of marine biodiversity is found. To maintain ecological integrity of this seascape, community-based marine conservation projects like the Calatagan Mangrove Forest Conservation Park (CMFCP) have been introduced. However, in the years of implementing these projects, studies to determine the importance of gender roles in conservation were very few. This study was conducted to analyze gender role participation of the people who worked in the conservation site. Conducted through field interviews, observations, and focus group discussions, the research adapted the analytical gender and environment framework by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation. In managing CMFCP, gender complementation was observed where tasks perceived as heavy were dominated by men and management of resources were done by women. In addition, there has been an observed increase of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participation to marine conservation in parallel to high number of women holding executive roles. Of the nineteen tasks identified, eight were participated by women. Productive work of women concentrated on wet season whereas their domestic roles were observed for both seasons. On the other hand, menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s productive role was observed for both seasons where their domestic roles were seen only during dry season. Both genders were knowledgeable on the different marine resources present in the area. Women were able to identify more resources than men in terms of class. This may be linked to womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role as tour guides. In this program, the rise of women working in marine conservation was observed.

736,"From community-based to centralised national management-A wrong turning for the governance of the marine protected area in Apo Island, Philippines?","Before the mid-1990s, Apo Island, Philippines, was often described as one of the world's best examples of community-based marine management. This paper studies the less-documented transition of the island during the late 1990s from community-based management to centralised national state management. Extensive interviewing of islanders has revealed deep misgivings about the centralised regime-the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB). PAMB's aim of implementing the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems (NIPAS) Act was initially looked upon favourably by islanders, but it has lost that support because of its exclusion of stakeholders from management and its poor institutional performance. The paper's conclusion is that the implementation of the NIPAS Act highlights the limitations of top-down management, and that there is a need to restore an element of local stakeholder participation in the governance of Apo's marine protected area (MPA). A system of co-management between community and national state actors is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability of Apo's marine resources. Ã‚Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

738,Characteristics and trends in required home care by GPs in Austria: Diseases and functional status of patients,"Background: Almost all societies carry responsibility towards patients who require continuous medical care at home. In many health systems the general practitioner cooperates with community based services of home care and coordinates all medical and non medical activities. In Austria the general practitioner together and in cooperation with relatives of the patient and professional organisations usually takes on this task by visiting his patients. This study was carried out to identify diseases that need home care and to describe the functional profile of home care patients in eastern Austria. Methods: Cross sectional observational study with 17 GP practices participating during 2 study periods in 1997 and in 2004 in eastern Austria. Each GP identified patients requiring home care and assessed their underlying diseases and functional status by filling in a questionnaire personally after an encounter. Patients in nursing homes were excluded. Statistical tests used were t-tests, contingency tables, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank sum test and Fisher-combination test. Results: Patients with degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (65%) caused by Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular occlusive disease and patients with degenerative diseases of the skeletal system (53%) were the largest groups among the 198 (1997) and 261 (2004) home care cases of the 11 (1997) and 13 (2004) practices. Malignant diseases in a terminal state constituted only 5% of the cases. More than two thirds of all cases were female with an average age of 80 years. Slightly more than 70% of the patients were at least partially mobile. Conclusion: Home care and home visits for patients with degenerative diseases of the central nervous and skeletal system are important elements of GP's work. Further research should therefore focus on effective methods of training and rehabilitation to better the mental and physical status of patients living in their private homes.

Indigenous TzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢utujil, Kaqchikel, and KÃ¢â‚¬â„¢icheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rely directly on lake water for drinking, bathing, cleaning, cooking, and fishing. Nonpoint source runoff and untreated wastewater pumped directly into the lake contribute to high fecal pathogen loads into source waters. Concurrent nutrient loading results in cyanobacterial blooms further compromising water quality. A lakeside municipality facing high rates of childhood gastrointestinal illness volunteered to engage in community-based participatory research (CBPR) to evaluate efficacy, utility, and longevity of filters in households. The filters consistently reduced the risk of coliforms and E. coli in household water drawn from the lake based on World Health Organization guidelines. Household surveys were simultaneously administered through a student leadership group regarding water usage, water quality, and community health. Filters demonstrated ability to reduce high loads of fecal indicators from source waters and ability to remove a cyanobacterial toxin (microcystin) at 10Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµg/L in deionized water. Further studies are imperative to determine longevity of use in households and CBPR provides a powerful avenue to test efficacy of a possible intervention while engaging stakeholders and empowering community members with sustainable solutions.

740,Can civic engagement lead to deliberative democratic governance?: The emergence and struggle of the Community Forest User Group Federation in Nepal,"Introduction Civic engagement is seen as an integral process of democracy, but there is limited understanding of the way it actually works in practice and in various contexts. As democratic theory takes a deliberative turn (Dryzek 2002), the importance of civic engagement has risen to prominence. The demand for active civic engagement in politics and governance is reinforced by the recent sweeping movements in the Middle East and the Arab World. In international development parlance, social capital is heralded as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“missing linkÃ¯Â¿Â½? in democratic governance (Grootaert 1998). In this view, social capital is a third major addition-after physical and human capital-to the conceptual and policy toolbox of democracy and development. This chapter problematizes the assumed positive links between social capital and civic engagement through an empirical examination of the case of community participation in NepalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forest governance. Through analyses of the evolution of a nationwide Federation of Community Forestry User Groups, Nepal (FECOFUN), I explore how active civic engagement can help democratize certain aspects of governance, while at the same time lead to more subtle forms of hegemony and control. Considering deliberative interactions between citizens and political leaders as a way to improve governance (Fisher 2003; Forester 1999), I explore the interplay between access to social capital and civic engagement in the governance processes. A strong argument for active civic engagement as a way to improve governance can be found in deliberative democratic ideas. Deliberative governance is inspired by the Habermasian notion of Ã¢â‚¬Å“discourse ethicsÃ¯Â¿Â½? (Habermas 1990, 1996) which stipulates that power relations are legitimate only when they are constituted through domination-free communicative reasoning. To analytically temper this ideal direction of civic engagement, I juxtapose communicative process with social capital following Bourdieu (1986, 1998), who sees it as a resource for contestation and as being constitutive of social differentiation. Contrary to the functionalist view of social capital as a vehicle for integration, Bourdieu holds that social capital is not always an openly accessible public good but a contested resource in specific social fields and, as such, it is a constitutive element of social differentiation. Furthermore, the extant structure of access to social capital has a direct bearing on the civic engagement potential of social actors-with those with a greater amount (and a higher quality) of social capital more likely to influence public policy through more active and influential civic engagement. I relate the structure of access and mechanisms of legitimacy in claiming social capital to the process of civic engagement and, hence, governance outcomes. Through the case of FECOFUN, I specifically address three questions. First, how does the civic engagement process advance in the context of a deeply technocratic governance regime (in this case, forest governance) and pervasive social inequality (and hence the highly inequitable regime of social capital)? Second, how do institutions for social capital shape the civic engagement process, and to what extent does the Ã¢â‚¬Å“social capital access regimeÃ¯Â¿Â½? explain accountability and internal governance of the civic network? And third, can marginalized groups gain better access to social capital through civic engagement and, if yes, how and under what conditions? Analysis of the FECOFUN case in relation to these questions offers important conceptual insights and empirical evidence into the way social capital and civic engagement interplay in the practice of governance. In this chapter, I argue that improved civic engagement is possible when the existing structure of access and distribution of social capital is questioned and modified toward the direction of fairness and equity. As the case of FECOFUN shows, in certain situations, civic engagement can also transform existing regimes of social capital. This is especially true when social capital is construed as a constitutive element in traditional social relations that harbor injustice in the realms of gender, caste, ethnicity, and more formal relations such as those between state institutions and people. NepalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s community forestry programme has a well-established history of over 30 years, and is often considered one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innovative models of civic engagement in the natural resource sector. The innovation entails the networking of over 16,000 community groups (covering one-third of 26 million people in Nepal) to articulate their voices and concerns in different spheres of forest governance, from local to national, and even international, levels. The direct participation of local communities in forest governance has resulted in some tan gible reversals in the previous trends of environmental degradation and the decline in forest product supply (Banjade 2008). Many people familiar with Nepal may ask how it was possible for such innovative civic engagement to emerge in a country that is marred by conflicts, poverty, political instability, and deep socio-cultural inequalities. And more importantly, are these visible successes really indicative of genuine processes of change in governance? In this chapter, I discuss how the community federation emerged and how it transformed existing social relations or capital and, then, advanced civic engagement in NepalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forest governance. I identify ways through which the agency, institutions, and practices of engagement was fostered, and in the process, how the structure of access to social capital as a private good-both among the actors in the federation and outside-has enabled some, and excluded others, in civic engagement processes. I place this analysis in the context of the federation trying to transform the techno-bureaucratic hegemony exercised by state forest agencies, usually with support from western development ideology of aid agencies, and the feudalistic culture of political institutions (Ojha 2006, 2008). I also identify the challenges in organizing civic engagement as the amount and types of social capital proliferate, with little change in the existing inequitable rules of access. I attempt to relate actual outcomes resulting from the engagement process to the literature on decentralized governance of natural resources management and deliberative governance. The analysis of civic engagement, and its potential for deepening understanding of how governance outcomes can become fairer, is extremely important to natural resource governance in general, and forest governance in particular. Globally, more than a billion people have some level of dependency on forests and live in poverty (Scherr et al. 2004). Recognizing the failures of state-centered approaches to forest management in the past (Gilmour and Fisher 1991; Malla 2001), there have been some efforts toward decentralization, which emphasize policy changes toward devolving power (and hence providing greater autonomy) to local communities (Agrawal and Ostrom 2001; Colfer and Capistrano 2005; Ribot 2003). As a result of these reforms, community-based forest management has evolved as a key strategy of conservation as well as promoting local livelihoods, especially in developing countries. But there is limited dialogue between the community-based resource management literature and the civic engagement and deliberative governance literature, which, if combined together, can shed new light on the working of democratic practice in resource governance. What is missing from both strands of literature is the exploration of community networking and federation building and their interactions with the state. This chapter is based on my reflective, experiential, and interactive accounts with FECOFUN since its formation in 1995. I have continuously been in touch with FECOFUN as a research partner, campaign co-organizer, and informal strategy advisor. I have also studied FECOFUN processes and practices and written technical papers (Ojha 2002, 2009; Ojha and Pokharel 2005; Ojha et al. 2007). This chapter builds on these earlier works, as well as a recent review of community networks in Asia (Dahal and Ojha 2010), and captures fresh insights and developments through the eyes of a close partner but critical observer of FECOFUN since its inception in 1995.

742,Integrated initiatives in support of urban and peri-urban horticulture,"The Integrated Initiative in Support of Urban and Peri-urban Horticulture (UPH) in Namibia was a project of the Ministry of Agriculture Water and Forestry (MAWF), sponsored by the Kingdom of Belgium, and with technical expertise from FAO. The project was implemented from August 2005 to December 2007. The objective of this project was to promote small-scale, intensive agriculture in urban areas, adapted not only to local environment conditions, but also to the needs of local producers and consumers for improved food security, nutrition and income generation. Hydroponics production techniques were extensively used to save water and to make production possible for people without land. The project set up two pilot sites, one in Windhoek (central Namibia) and another in Rundu (northeast Namibia). Activities such as micro-gardens, vermi-compost production, drum-and-drip irrigation, mushroom and fruit tree production, integrated fish farming, and good agricultural practices were undertaken. By December 2007, the project had trained many people including technicians from MAWF. The project also monitored research projects by graduates from the Polytechnic University of Namibia and captured the data into the Hortivar database. People living with HIV/Aids also benefited by improving their nutrition. Others were able to supplement their incomes by selling surplus produce at the market. The project established partnerships with local NGOs, UN sister agencies, government institutions, and community based organisations (CBOs). The project won a gold medal as the Best Exhibition Indoor at the Windhoek Agricultural Society Show in October 2007.

743,Moving toward sustainability in the local management of floodplain lake fisheries in the Brazilian Amazon,"Local management systems are generally regarded as traditional systems developed over generations. However, in the Brazilian Amazon, as in many other regions, community or collective management is a response to more recent changes in the exploitation of local fisheries and other common-pool resources. Greeted with optimism initially as a potentially effective way of reconciling social and conservation objectives in rural development, experience with community management over the last decade has shown that achieving this potential can be elusive. This paper examines the process of forming community agreements for the floodplain lake fisheries of the Lower Amazon through the analysis of 77 written fishing documents produced from 1981 to 1997. We examine approaches to resource management revealed in the accords, the institutional arrangements for implementing them, and evaluate the performance of these accords over this 15-year period. The paper focuses on the strengths and limitations of this institution in its social and ecological characteristics, institutional robustness, and evolving relations with parallel changes in formal government management policy for regional fisheries.",NA,No,"The paper's case study is based in the Brazilian Amazon, not in any of the specified Pacific Island countries."," No; The paper is focused on the Brazilian Amazon, not any of the listed Pacific Island countries.

744,Restoration of Hong Kong fisheries through deployment of artificial reefs in marine protected areas,"We provide details of a restoration programme to restore Hong Kong's marine ecosystems and fisheries through the deployment of artificial reefs (AR) within marine parks and fishery-protected areas (FPA). The programme is being implemented in two phases. The first phase has involved AR deployment in recently established marine parks. The second phase will involve the establishment of FPA selected specifically for their suitability for AR deployment and fisheries restoration. Prior to site selection, a comprehensive two-stage consultation exercise was conducted, which targeted fishers, marine users and green groups. Ecosystem simulations were employed to assess the potential benefits to fisheries arising from the implementation of the second phase. Modelling results indicate that AR deployment, utilizing 10-20% of local waters managed predominantly as no-take zones, could arrest the current decline in fisheries yield and produce significant improvements within ten years. Limited selective fishing may be authorized at a small number of AR to encourage support from local fishers and facilitate enforcement. Successful implementation must involve a high level of fishing compliance within the 'no-take' zones. Management should be facilitated by establishing community-based advisory groups for each FPA that will comprise representatives from fishers, government and academics. They will be responsible, in addition to providing advice, for assisting with management issues including fishing permit allocation. The benefits and problems associated with different restoration initiatives are discussed. Ã‚Â© 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

746,"Foregone harvests and neoliberal policies: Creating opportunities for rural, small-scale, community-based fisheries in southern Alaskan coastal villages","Neoliberal policies of effort limitation and privatization have reduced commercial salmon and other fishing opportunities available to the coastal, predominantly Alaska Native, villages of southern Alaska. However, there are a variety of circumstances, including the manner in which the current commercial fishery is prosecuted, that lead to surpluses of unharvested salmon, and potentially other species, available in certain areas. This paper will define the concept of ""foregone harvests"", discuss the environmental and managerial conditions that lead to ""foregone harvests"" and describe the possibilities such conditions create for the development of small-scale, local and community-based fisheries. Case studies of possible Huna Tlingit (Hoonah) and Kaigani Haida (Hydaburg) salmon fisheries will be presented. Alternative arrangements of salmon fisheries and institutions in southeast Alaska are presented through case studies of the villages of Yakutat and Metlakatla.

747,Innovative education and training for community-based water protection units,"The paper explores the centrality of community-based education and training in addressing constraints and opportunities for wastewater management in Uganda. To be sustainable, wastewater management need to be conceived in terms of socio-economic incentives, community action, group pressure and social capital. It is assumed that communities could be motivated to undertake sustainable wastewater disposal activities if con- crete benefits are demonstrated. The benefits include among others; reducing expenditure on health; improvement of the fisheries sector and the use of wastewater for crop farming. The paper is based on a study that analyzed the role of socio-economic incentives and Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) in sustainable management of wastewater. Data was collected through personal interviews, documents analysis and review of recent studies on wastewater reuse in Uganda. Focus was put on districts of Mukono, Buikwe and Kayunga in central Uganda. Findings reveal that in line with the Hydro-Social-Health cycle, physical, social, political, econ- omic, and cultural factors converge to influence wastewater management.

748,"Monitoring, assessing, and managing fish stocks in Lake Malawi/Nyassa: Current approaches and future possibilities","Approaches to the provision of advice on fishery management are changing from reliance on single species stock assessments to multi-species, multi-gear, and ecosystem approaches. Many of these new approaches may, however, be too expensive to apply to small-scale fisheries in developing countries. The fish stocks of Lake Malawi/Nyassa are currently managed by restrictions on fishing gears, fishing areas, and fishing times. Catch statistics and an annual frame survey of fishing effort provide input data for stock assessment studies that are used to derive these recommendations. This management approach is ineffective with several important fish stocks in decline, reports of local species extinctions, and changes in community structure as a result of the disappearance of larger, more valuable species. Failure to enforce management regulations results partly from an imbalance of economic and human resource allocation between the collection of monitoring data, timely analysis of that data, production of workable recommendations, and enforcement of these recommendations. We recommend redressing the imbalance through a reduction in the scale of catch surveys so that resources can be redirected towards data processing, timely provision of advice, management actions, and enforcement. A number of further modifications are recommended to improve and better match the levels of precision of catch and effort data. The implications of current moves away from ""state-led"" management to ""community-based"" management are discussed briefly.",NA,No,"The study is based on Lake Malawi/Nyassa, not in any of the countries listed in the SC."," No; The paper is focused on Lake Malawi/Nyassa, which is not located in any of the countries listed in the SC.

749,Local fisheries conservation and management works: implications of migrations and site fidelity of Arapaima in the Lower Amazon,"Effective conservation must account for fish migrations to minimize threats to freshwater fishes. Many floodplain fishes, like giant Neotropical arapaima (genus Arapaima), migrate laterally into seasonally flooded habitats to feed and reproduce. Effects of seasonal migrations on conservation efforts like community-based management remain uncertain. Acoustic telemetry was applied to arapaima in floodplain habitats (Lower Amazon) to characterize (1) lake fidelity, (2) lake population connectivity, and (3) migrations beyond managed units. During low water of 2014, 24 arapaima were captured and implanted with acoustic tags in three lakes within a 10-km diameter and across two fishing communities. During floods, the entire study area was connected, including tagging lakes. Monitoring was continuous over two annual flood cycles using an array of 19 fixed acoustic receivers in four lakes. Additional nearby lakes were surveyed with portable receivers for unaccounted individuals during subsequent dry seasons. On average, 74% of unharvested arapaima returned to the same lake; no arapaima were found outside their lake of tagging origin during subsequent dry seasons. During high water, arapaima migrations were not contained within community management units; three arapaima were found outside their community zone. Overlapping distributions of arapaima from each of three lake populations showed connectivity during flooding, especially near known spawning grounds. Results demonstrate that management by local fishers to regulate fishing within lakes can work because arapaima show fidelity to their lake of tagging origin. Current management efforts could be improved by delineating management units to networks of habitats that sustain arapaima over complete life histories.

750,The psychological impacts of community-based protected areas,"This cross-sectional and mixed-methods study uses Self-Determination Theory and the Theory of Basic Human Values to investigate changes in motivations, attitudes, beliefs and values following the establishment of community-based marine protected areas (MPAs). Open-ended and retrospective questions, as well as survey instruments, were used in six communities with different-aged (new: 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3Ã‚Â years old, medium-aged: 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11Ã‚Â years old and old: 20Ã¢â‚¬â€œ25Ã‚Â years old) MPAs in the Philippines. Respondents included both community members either involved (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 101) or not involved (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 108) in MPA management. Respondents reported increased appreciation for the benefits of MPAs and more positive attitudes about MPAs over time. In comparison to respondents from communities with new MPAs, respondents in communities with medium-aged and old MPAs identified a wider range of MPA impacts on themselves (e.g. new friendships, learning and greater pro-environmental values), their community (e.g. increased fish catch, social capital), and on ecosystems (e.g. different species and ecosystems-types). Similarly, respondents from medium-aged and old MPAs had fewer non-autonomous motivations (i.e. motivations arising externally, such as social status or pay) to engage in MPA management and also had higher self-transcendence values, such as caring for nature. These results suggest that community-based MPAs may encourage psychological shifts in communities such as greater autonomous motivation to care for nature and enhanced self-transcendence values, both of which may support conservation. By developing a more holistic approach to assessing the multi-faceted impacts of community-based conservation, this type of psychological research helps to identify and prioritize timely actions in the establishment and maintenance of resilient and sustainable community-based MPAs.

751,"Identifying management preferences, institutional organisational rules, and their capacity to improve fisheries management in Pemba, Mozambique","The potential to improve the management of fisheries in Pemba, Mozambique, were explored by evaluating stakeholder's preferences for management and the key institutional design elements of the fisheries organisations or community councils of fisheries (CCPs). We interviewed fishers, community leaders and government fisheries officers regarding (1) their perceptions about different fisheries restrictions, (2) their socio-economic conditions, and (3) the institutional design and rules of the CCP arrangements. Fishers had low levels of education (&lt;4 years) and biweekly expenditures of around US$100, and they were permanent residents of their villages, being part of large households (9-12 members). Apart from effort restrictions, respondents' perceptions were similar and strongly supported a range of fisheries regulations, particularly gear and minimum size restrictions. The suggested minimum size of captured fish was 20.6 cm (SD 3.0), whereas the suggested size of closed areas was 8.4 km2 (SD 2.0). Fishers associated with community or conservation groups generally had more positive views of spatial closures and other less-preferred management restrictions. A number of the essential design principles for fisheries rules were in place with the exception of graduated sanctions.

752,Economic feasibility of community-based fish culture in seasonally flooded rice fields in Bangladesh and Vietnam,"During the rainy season in extensive river floodplains and deltaic lowlands, floods lasting several months render the land unavailable for crop production for several months each year. These waters are considerably underutilized in terms of managed aquatic productivity. This raises the opportunity to enclose parts of these annually occurring floodwater areas to produce a crop of specifically stocked aquatic organisms aside from the naturally occurring 'wild' species that are traditionally fished and are not affected by the culture activity, overall resulting in more high-quality, nutrient-dense food production and enhanced farm income for all stakeholders, notably the poor. The WorldFish Center and its national partners recently tested two systems in a community based management approach in Bangladesh and Vietnam: (i) concurrent rice-fish culture in shallower flooded areas, and (ii) alternating rice and fish culture in the deep-flooded areas. Results indicate that community-based fish culture in rice fields is technically feasible, economically viable and socially acceptable. It can increase fish production to about 600 kg/ha/year in shallow flooded areas and up to 1.5 t/ha/year in deep-flooded areas, without reduction in rice yield and wild fish catch. For the overall system and in the trials conducted, an additional income of US$135 per ha in southern Vietnam, and up to US$437 per ha in Bangladesh were achieved, which is an increase of 20% to 85% over the previous profitability.

The guidelines provide an agreed starting point to initiate a site-planning effort, help organize a complicated process into discrete components, incorporate principles of community-based and collaborative management, minimize the risk of conflict by directly involving representatives of all interest groups and identifying and addressing all issues at an incipient stage, promote development of a sense of ownership and support for resulting management initiatives by all stakeholders, address the cumulative effects of adverse impacts to coastal and marine environments, and implement an integrated approach by considering all interrelated elements that affect the site through the collaboration of all interest groups. Site-planning is a process of reviewing past progress and assessing current and future issues, threats, and needs to identify priority management intervention activities that will sustain ecological, economic, and cultural values; balance multiple and often incompatible objectives; address priority threats to natural ecosystem functioning; conserve ecological processes and biodiversity; achieve sustainable development; and fulfill institutional, policy, and legal needs.

755,Adult cancer patient recruitment and enrollment into cell phone text message trials,"Introduction: Text messaging (TMs) on cell phones is emerging as an effective means of delivering behavioral interventions. However, little is known about TM use in adult cancer patients. The present study aimed to extend knowledge on acceptability of a TM intervention in adult cancer patients; examine factors of those screened and enrolled; and compare recruitment at a large national specialty pharmacy versus community-based cancer clinics. Materials and Methods: Screening, enrollment, and baseline data collected in two randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of TMs on medication adherence or symptom severity in adults prescribed oral anticancer agents were linked. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, t-tests, and generalized linear modeling were used to examine sociodemographics, cancer type and stage, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, social support, and symptoms. Results: The cancer clinics screened 293 patients, 43% were eligible, and 56% consented. The specialty pharmacy screened 169 patients, 72% were eligible, and 74% consented. Mean age was 58 years and did not differ by recruitment setting. Later stage disease (p = 0.01) and higher number of symptoms (p < 0.01), and symptom severity (p = 0.02) and interference (p = 0.01) were observed among patients recruited at the specialty pharmacy. No group differences were found for depression, physical function, cognition, self-efficacy, or social support. Discussion: Adult cancer patients were likely to participate in a TM intervention trial.

756,"The economic impacts of the recreational bluefin tuna fishery in Hatteras, North Carolina","Little is known about a recreational fishery for bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus that emerged in the winter months (1994-1996) near Hatteras, North Carolina. Our research sought to better understand this developing fishery, especially the extent of local and statewide economic impacts and the resultant implications for public and private fisheries management decision making at the local level. We used a quota-based sampling approach to collect names and addresses from charter and private boat anglers in Hatteras; 1,051 anglers were sampled and received a mail questionnaire soon after project personnel intercepted them. Technicians recorded a total of 1,390 bluefin tuna boat trips (1,020 charter boat trips and 370 private boat trips) between January 15 and March 22, 1997. These 1,390 trips resulted in an estimated 6,546 angler-days of bluefin tuna fishing from Hatteras. Trips by North Carolina residents accounted for only 15.6% of the total number of trips. Each angler spent an average of US$1,005 in the Hatteras area on his/her trip. Anglers who reported their boat retained a legal-sized bluefin tuna spent slightly less on their trips and per day of fishing than anglers who released all bluefin tuna caught. Overall, the population of bluefin tuna anglers in the Hatteras area spent $3,635,654 locally and $ 212,036 elsewhere in the state of North Carolina. These expenditures resulted in a total output of $4,627,108 and $5,032,870 on the Hatteras-area economy and North Carolina economy, respectively. The $3,436,654 in direct expenditures made by nonlocal anglers for local goods and services generated an additional $991,500 in economic output, resulting in a total output of $4,627,108 (output multiplier = 1.35) and 126 full and part-time jobs attributable to this fishery in 1997. At the state level, the bluefin tuna fishery had a similar economic impact, because many of the anglers were not North Carolina residents. Specifically, the total output associated with this fishery at the state level was $5,032,870.

757,Making the transition to co-management governance arrangements in HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi: A framework for understanding transaction and transformation costs,"Co-management has shown great promise in achieving social and ecological goals worldwide. Despite its potential, significant challenges are faced during governance transformations shifting from traditional approaches to fisheries management to co-management systems. Several factors make HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi an excellent opportunity to study the barriers associated with implementing co-management systems. HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi implements many of the same types of regulatory and fisheries programs found elsewhere in the U.S., yet it also possesses a unique legacy of customary management systems. In addition, a legal pathway has existed for nearly two decades that allows communities to partner with the State of HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi to co-manage nearshore coral reef fisheries. Despite the presence of this enabling legislation, extensive community interest in this approach across the archipelago, and significant NGO/Foundation support, co-management implementation remains limited. This study uses a mixed methods approach that relies on semi-structured interviews and archival data sources to conduct an institutional analysis of transaction and transformation costs. These costs serve as barriers to co-management implementation. The study identifies several social and organizational barriers preventing co-management implementation including: governmental structure and operations; planning and administrative processes; organized opposition from special interests; and consensus building processes. The institutional analysis further reveals a wide range of transaction and transformation costs associated with this governance transformation that prevent adoption of co-management. We conclude by identifying some actions that can help reduce these implementation barriers to co-management transitions and prevent conservation stalemates.

758,Study on acute HIV-1 infection in men who have sex with men in Tianjin,"Objective: To understand the immunological and virological characteristics of HIV-1 infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in the acute phase in Tianjin and evaluate the effects of the fourth generation HIV ELISA and the P24 ELISA for acute HIV-1 infected samples. Methods: From October 2015 to October 2016, MSM were recruited through the community-based organizations in Tianjin. All the participants received rapid HIV test, positive samples were confirmed by Western Blot and negative samples underwent pooled nucleic acid testing. The participants with HIV-1 RNA reactive result underwent testing for viral load and T-cell count after second blood collection. Acute HIV-1 infection was defined as negative rapid HIV test result and the positive results of two HIV RNA tests, then the sensitivity were compared between the fourth generation HIV ELISA and the P24 ELISA to detect the initial HIV-1 RNA positive samples. Results: Among 3 016 MSM screened, 193 were positive in rapid HIV test. Western blot testing indicated that 179 cases were HIV positive, 7 cases were HIV indeterminate and 7 cases were negative. Of 2 823 sero-negative cases, 17 were acute HIV-1 infections. The HIV-1 infection rate was 6.53% (197/3 016) and the acute HIV-1 infection rate was 0.56% (17/3 016), with an average viral load of (5.63 Ã‚Â± 1.50) logm copies/ml, an average CD4 count of (442.82 Ã‚Â± 268.17) cells/ÃŽÂ¼1, an average CDS count of (1 069.65 Ã‚Â± 668.22) cells/ÃŽÂ¼l and an average CD 4 /CD 8 . ratio of (0.49 Ã‚Â± 0.25). Higher viral load, CD 4 and CD 4 /CD 8 ratio were seen in the acute HIV-1 infection group compared with the chronic HIV-1 infection group (U= 148, P&lt;0.01; U= 272, P=0.042 and t = 3.147, P=0.005). Demographic characteristics were similar between two groups, except the occupation (Ãâ€¡ 2 = 11.016, P=0.026). The sensitivity of P24 ELISA was higher than the fourth generation HIV ELISA in the HIV-1 detection for acute infection (Fisher's exact test, P= 0.017). Conclusions: MSM are at risk for acute HIV-1 infection. Screening for acute HIV-1 infection with P24 ELISA would increase the sensitivity of diagnosis and reduce HIV transmission in MSM.

759,Community-based management of the Mediterranean coastal fisheries: Historical reminiscence or the root for new fisheries governance?,"Historical management experiences of Mediterranean community-based fisheries were particularly effective in fostering both social cohesion and sustainable utilizationof coastal resources. This figure contrasts with the current status of Mediterranean fisheries, where about 90% of stocks are overexploited. The key question then is: can past experiences guide our current approach to reshaping governance in the Mediterranean fisheries? In our effort to answer this question, we analyzed the main attributes of selected fishing governance systems in the Early and Mid-Modern period and their evolution through time. We focussed on the Spanish CofradÃƒÂ­as, the French Prud'homies and the Venetian Fraglie (Italy). They were characterized by the establishment of territorial user rights system of management and governed technical aspects of the fisheries, market access, and restrictions. Fishers and their communities, through their corporations/organizations, were directly involved in legislating and enforcing management policies and regulations/rules. This approach to fisheries management differs from the one introduced by the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), established in the late 1970s, which was mainly top-down. Despite the systematic efforts to reduce fishing capacity and pressure on marine resources and to impose severe technical and restrictive measures, Mediterranean fisheries are still in bad conditions. To cope with this situation the EU recently reformed the CFP establishing, among other things, a new paradigm that seeks to foster the harmonization of the decision-making process in the context of the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“regionalizationÃ¢â‚¬Â of fisheries management. However, this policy does not clearly establish a proper community-based approach and restricts participation to national fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ associations in the context of the Advisory Council of the Mediterranean Sea. Without effectively linking local and regional fisheries management structures by engaging fishers and re-establishing a sense of community through providing community-based rights for fishing, this new effort will likely not succeed in achieving Mediterranean fisheries sustainability.

760,"Barriers and facilitators to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility screening and ongoing HIV testing among target populations in Bondo and Rarieda, Kenya: Results of a consultation with community stakeholders","Background: As pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) moves closer to availability in developing countries, practical considerations for implementation become important. We conducted a consultation with district-level community stakeholders experienced in HIV-prevention interventions with at-risk populations in Bondo and Rarieda, Kenya to generate locally grounded approaches to the future rollout of oral PrEP to four populations: fishermen, widows, female sex workers, and serodiscordant couples. Methods. The 20 consultation participants represented the Ministry of Health, faith- and community-based organizations, health facilities, community groups, and nongovernmental organizations. Participants divided into breakout groups and followed a structured discussion guide asking them to identify barriers to implementing HIV-prevention interventions (including PrEP) with each population. Questions also solicited solutions for addressing these barriers, as well as other facilitators for PrEP implementation. In particular, questions focused on how to encourage people to screen for PrEP eligibility by having HIV and other blood tests and how to encourage compliance with ongoing HIV testing. Results: The barriers and facilitators/solutions discussants provided were frequently population-specific, but there were also broad-level similarities across populations. Service delivery barriers to HIV-prevention interventions concerned the need for staff trained to address the needs of particular populations. Service delivery facilitators to provision of ongoing HIV testing consisted of offering testing options besides facility-based testing. Stigma was the main community-level barrier for all groups, whereas barriers at the level of target populations included mobility; lifestyle and life circumstances, especially cultural norms among fishermen and widows; and fears, lack of awareness, and misinformation. Proposed facilitators and strategies for addressing community- and population-level barriers included topic-specific education within the populations and community, involvement of partners and family members, mass HIV testing, and peer educators. Barriers to PrEP uptake included non-adherence to pill taking and missing clinic visits. For drug adherence, facilitators were counselling and involving family members. Discussants suggested that client reminders, e.g., home visits, were needed to encourage clients to keep their clinic appointments. Conclusions: Strategies for encouraging eligibility screening and ongoing HIV testing will have local and population-specific aspects. Our results nonetheless apply to similar populations throughout sub-Saharan Africa and reach beyond oral PrEP to other ARV-based PrEP formulations.

761,A study on the impact of the 2017 early monsoon flash flood: Potential measures to safeguard livelihoods from extreme climate events in the haor area of Bangladesh,"The northeastern part of Bangladesh is characterized by a unique wetland ecosystem called haor, which experiences regular monsoon flooding starting from late May/June. But change in rainfall pattern over last few decades has resulted in increased risk of early monsoon flash floods like the flood of 2017, which wreaked havoc in the haor at the beginning of April. Through a cross sectional survey covering 1845 flood affected households, the present study aims at understanding this flood's effects on their livelihoods and recommending policies to safeguard livelihoods in the face of changing climate. Analysis of rainfall and river water level data revealed that heavy rainfall in the haor and adjacent Indian sub-catchments were the main reasons behind this unprecedented event. Loss of income because of this flood was common, but was more prevalent among the older respondents, people having lower educational attainment and persons dependent on natural resources-based occupations. Most of the people who were forced to switch occupations experienced reduction in average daily income, irrespective of whatever occupations they switched to. Food insecurity was common among all groups, but was predominant among fishermen and day labourers. Integrated measures including development of real-time early warning system, community-based early response, proper management of crop protection embankments and regular dredging of waterways are essential to reduce the vulnerability of the people to flood. Furthermore, rapid expansion of newly developed short duration rice varieties (e.g. BRRI dhan 81), employment of case seedlings/raised-bed seedlings in elevated lands to ensure high quality timely transplantation immediately after recession of stagnant water, introduction of other profitable crops, poultry and dairy farming (e.g. sheep farming), creation of skill-based alternative livelihood options to adapt the agriculture sector with the changing climate. An equitable investment by the government is crucial to foster the economic growth by ending poverty by 2030, and to secure decent income, better livelihood and food security of the haor inhabitants.

762,Managing Small Fish at LargeÃ‚Â Scales: The Emergence of Regional Policies for River Herring in the Eastern United States,"Anadromous Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus and Blueback Herring A. aestivalis, collectively known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“river herring,Ã¢â‚¬Â provide ecosystem services to coastal communities in the Eastern United States. Despite traditions of community-based stewardship, many populations exhibit long-term declines. Their name notwithstanding, river herring spend most of their lives at sea and stray among natal rivers. Therefore, absence of management above individual rivers can compromise population viability, local conservation investments, and ecosystem services. Large-scale management in the USA was achieved for the first time during 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2015 by amending three Fishery Management Plans and creating a broader River Herring Conservation Plan following an Endangered Species Act petition. Concurrently, an international restoration plan for river herring in the St. Croix River on the USAÃ¢â‚¬â€œCanada border was adopted. A survey of stakeholder organizations in New England during this period revealed widespread concern for stressors managed at different scales, but that most action was directed locally. Stakeholder collaboration networks were clustered within states and around loose regional hubs, matching the scales of stakeholder concerns and actions. Unfortunately, river herring face growing threats linked to climate change, effects of which will be felt at local and regional scales, while effective mitigation will require actions at national and global scales.

763,Evaluating coral reef ecosystem services outcomes from climate change adaptation strategies using integrative system dynamics,"Coral reef ecosystems provide a broad spectrum of essential ecological, economic and cultural services for Small Island Developing State (SIDS) communities. However, coral reef communities are increasingly threatened by the adverse impacts of human activities at both global and local scales. This study aims to develop an integrated dynamic assessment framework to evaluate coral reef conditions under different adaptation and climate change scenarios, and their consequential economic impacts in the small island community of Port Resolution on Tanna Island in Vanuatu. Our assessment framework follows a sequential multilayered modelling approach that uses System Dynamics (SD) coupled with Bayesian Network (BN) modelling to deal with the complexity and dynamicity of socioeconomic and environmental systems, and impacts from trans-discipline variables. The BN incorporated existing data and expert knowledge to project the future conditions of coral reefs under different scenario settings, and to parametrise and quantify the SD model where the existing data and information was insufficient. The SD was then used to simulate the dynamic relationship between coral reef condition and the economic benefits derived from its ecosystem services under different climate change (i.e. RCPs) and management scenarios through to 2070. Our findings show that sustainable community-based conservation management strategies are key to preserving the flow of coral reef ecosystem services under RCP 2.6 and 6.0. Importantly, we demonstrate that the implementation of an integrated portfolio of management strategies better protects ecosystem services provided by coral reefs and maximises the total economic benefits achieved over the long-term despite a temporary and short-term economic loss due to high initial capital investments and income reduction due to fishing and tourism restrictions.

Built on survey data from 200 households conducted in 2012 we analysed the trade-off between conservation and development objectives by means of a mathematical programming model representing the economy of a rural conservancy in Namibia. We found that in the scenario describing unrestricted resource extraction, local communities mainly benefit from fishing and utilising forest products. In comparison, the scenario representing the social optimum, implying sustainably managed fish stocks and appropriate diets for community inhabitants, shows that community households increase agricultural diversification and shift livelihoods towards tourism employment.

765,"Allies, not aliens: Increasing the role of local communities in marine protected area implementation","Various management approaches have been proposed to address the alarming depletion of marine coastal resources. Prominent among them are community-based management and the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). The overall poor performance of MPAs can be traced to a failure to effectively include local communities in the design and implementation of relevant measures. Recent efforts have incorporated aspects of community-based management into a hybrid form of management, which ideally builds upon existing local management practices. A key challenge lies in the development of appropriate frameworks that allow for the successful participation of local communities in management. A review of studies on MPA design and community-based marine resource management and fieldwork observations provides suggestions on how to address current socioeconomic shortcomings in MPA design and implementation, successfully involving local communities in order to provide a better local basis for effective larger MPA networks. A combination of MPA tools as the formal frame and community-based natural resource management as the adaptive core that recognizes local communities as allies, not aliens, is needed to develop successful conservation approaches.

767,Social communication network analysis of the role of participatory research in the adoption of new fish consumption behaviors,"The formulation and communication of fish advisories are highly complex because of the potential conflict between the nutritional and toxicological issues associated with fish consumption. Government and organization-sponsored fish advisories have had limited success in changing behaviors. Participatory approaches may enhance the understanding of complex issues and the adoption of new behaviors. Here we used social network analysis to investigate the adoption of dietary changes within the context of a community participatory research project. In the Brazilian Amazon, many communities are highly exposed to methylmercury from fish consumption. A participatory intervention based on dietary changes aimed at reducing methylmercury exposure while maintaining fish consumption was initiated in 1995. In 2001, we collected data on individual participation in the research, on the discussion network regarding mercury issues and on changes in fish consumption from 96 of the 110 village households. More than half of men and women had adopted new fish consumption behavior to reduce mercury exposure. Adoption was associated with participation in the research project for both women and men, and with a higher number of discussion partners about mercury issues for women. Adoption was likewise associated with the presence of a female communication partner in the personal networks of both men and women. At the household level, men and women who considered their spouse as a discussion partner were more likely to adopt than those who did not. Opinion le]adership was associated with change in fish consumption only for women. We discuss the contribution of community participation and communication networks to overcome the difficulties in generating complex messages that take into account both health benefits and risks of fish consumption. We also discuss the relevance of building preventive health programs based on participatory research approaches and the roles and relations specific to men and women.

More yield or output against same or less amount of water has become the global interest. Objectives: This study measures the productivity of water on the floodplain land in terms of Boro rice cultivation for two floodplain beels in Rajshahi Bangladesh. Materials & Methods: For this study, the production and market price data were collected by direct observation based on 30 samples in the year 2006-07. Results: This study found gross water productivity of rice yield as 0.47 kg nv3 in beelMail and 0.43 kg nv3 in beel Chandpur. In monetary value, water productivity per cubic meter irrigation water were TK 5.65, TK 3.42 and TK 2.64 based on gross return, net return considering cash costs and net return considering full costs in tee/Mail. In beel Chandpur these values were TK 5.19 nv3, TK 2.87 nv3 and TK 2.14 nv3, respectively. The usage of average irrigated water in the boro rice farms were estimated 10730.05 nv3 and 11236 nv3with an average production of yield 4992.95 kg and 4783.20 kg in tee/Mail and beel Chandpur. Statistical result shows that keeping irrigation water constant, a 1% increase of boro rice yield will increase water productivity at 0.916% in beel Mail and 0.972% in beel Chandpur. The water productivity in beel Mail was 4.65% higher than beel Chandpur due to the intervention of community based fish culture management.

772,Assessing the effects of marine protected area (MPA) on a reef fish assemblage in a northwestern Mediterranean marine reserve: Identifying community-based indicators,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly envisaged as a tool to manage coastal ecosystems and fisheries. Assessment of their performance with respect to management objectives is therefore important. A number of MPAs provided conservation benefits for fished species. Observed benefits do not apply to all species at all times, and responses to protection are also highly variable among fish taxa. Among the many empirical studies on marine reserves, only a few designs considered 'before and after data' and spatial variation. In this paper, we are interested in assessing the effect of a no-take reserve on the reef fish assemblage in a northwestern Mediterranean example. Data were obtained from a three-year survey using underwater visual censuses (UVC), before and after MPA establishment. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to evaluate the effects of reserve protection on the reef fish assemblage, while accounting for habitat. Modelled biological responses were abundances and diversity indices calculated at different levels of the assemblage. Significant effects were found for many of these metrics. In addition to PERMANOVA, univariate models provided more insight into the magnitude and direction of effects. The most sensitive metrics were related to large species and species targeted by fishing. These results may be used to choose the metrics that are more suitable as community-based indicators of MPA impact in the perspective of monitoring programs. Ã‚Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

773,Household finances and trust are key determinants of benefits from small-scale fisheries co-management,"Socioeconomic conditions of small-scale fishing households often influence the benefits communities accrue from fisheries management interventions. Adjacent to seven newly established fisheries comanagement areas initiated in 2018, we examine the attributes of fishing households that influence perceived food, finance and job security, and compliance with fishing closures. We interviewed respondents from 1828 fishing households in 2019 and 2025 households in 2021 across the seven areas in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. A key finding was that perceived food, financial and job security outcomes increased over the two-year period and were positively related to respondents knowledge of fisheries comanagement. Relationships between both household savings and loans and with household food security highlights the need for policy and institutional support for fishing households in times of need. Household income from fisheries and trust in community leaders was also related to higher reported compliance with fishing closures, suggesting that income security and community leadership are important drivers of adoption of comanagement resource harvest rules. In contrast, women who identified as fish processors reported that they did not comply with fishing closures, as likely they were not involved in management decision making. Moreover, the positive impact of respondent's trust in their community, on food, financial and job security, implies that strong community relationships can benefit well-being of coastal communities. Our findings highlight the need for programs that strengthen community institutions, improve household financial literacy, promote access to financial services and recognize gendered roles in fishing, as integral parts of community-based fisheries management.

Following the collaborative design of a community-based socialÃ¢â‚¬â€œecological monitoring system over two traditional seafood harvesting seasons, we conducted a conceptual framework analysis of meeting notes and interview transcripts with Gitga'at harvesters and knowledge holders to discern how Gitga'at people monitor their territory and what indicators they focus on. An interconnected set of socialÃ¢â‚¬â€œecological concepts and indicators emerged, evidencing an intrinsic part of Gitga'at life: Gitga'at harvesters closely monitor their coastal socialÃ¢â‚¬â€œecological system through ongoing land- and sea-based practices. The conceptual framework highlights the importance of maintaining and revitalizing Indigenous knowledge and harvesting practices to inform socialÃ¢â‚¬â€œecological monitoring and adaptive management at local and broader scales. Amidst discussions of marine and coastal resource co-management in British Columbia, our results also suggest opportunities for scientific approaches to situate themselves within and support existing Indigenous frameworks and priorities. This research also adds to the discussion on the development of appropriate regional and global indicators and frameworks to monitor the resilience of socialÃ¢â‚¬â€œecological systems.

775,A novel method for mapping reefs and subtidal rocky habitats using artificial neural networks,"Reefs and subtidal rocky habitats are sites of high biodiversity and productivity which harbour commercially important species of fish and invertebrates. Although the conservation management of reef associated species has been informed using species distribution models (SDM) and community based approaches, to date their use has been constrained to specific regions where the locality and spatial extent of reefs is well known. Much of the world's subtidal habitats remain either undiscovered or unmapped, including coasts of intense human use. Consequently, to facilitate a stronger understanding of species-environmental relationships there is an urgent need for a cost and time effective standard method to map reefs at fine spatial resolutions across broad geographical extents. We used bathymetric data (Ã¢Ë†Â¼250. m resolution) to calculate the local slope and curvature of the seabed. We then constructed artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast the probability of reef occurrence within grid cells as a function of bathymetric and slope variables. Testing over an independent data set not used in training showed that ANNs were able to accurately predict the location of reefs for 86% of all grid cells (Kappa = 0.63) without over fitting. The ANN with greatest support, combining bathymetric values of the target grid cell with the slope of adjacent grid cells, was used to map inshore reef locations around the Southern Australian coastline (Ã¢Ë†Â¼250. m resolution). Broadly, our results show that reefs are identifiable from coarse-scale bathymetry data of the seabed. We anticipate that our research technique will strengthen systematic conservation planning tools in many regions of the world, by enabling the identification of rocky substratum and mapping in localities that remain poorly surveyed due to logistics or monetary constraints.

777,Exploring benefits of spatial cooperative harvesting in a sea urchin fishery: An agent-based approach,"Sedentary or low-mobility organisms show a high degree of dependency with their substrate, where its heterogeneity often determines small-scale spatial patterns of distribution, life history traits, and fishery yields. For sea urchins, this spatial structure is usually shaped by food availability, habitat structure, individual movement, and fishery dynamics. All of these have a significant impact on their physiological and reproductive status and in particular on their gonadal content. These patterns are of particular interest considering that the sea urchin fishery is a roe fishery where marketability depends on gonad yield and quality, which in turn is related to spatial and temporal variations in associated kelp beds. Thus, better gonad quality and yields generate higher profits for both fishers (divers) and processors. However, competition among divers within a non-cooperative system creates a ""race for shellfish"" precluding higher gonad yields per unit of effort. A spatially explicit agent-based model for the San Diego, California red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) fishery was developed in order to assess the benefits of cooperative harvesting by depicting spatial and temporal variations in fishery yields. A cooperative harvesting scenario where divers consistently target those areas with higher yields avoiding low-quality sea urchins was compared against a non-cooperative situation where divers harvest at random or based only on densities of sea urchins. Sea urchin population at the end of the simulation period was 20% higher for the most cooperative scenario compared to the non-cooperative fishery. Further, for the most cooperative scenario where information sharing among divers is greatest and harvest is coordinated, sea urchin catches were at least 10% higher and gonad yield 35% higher than in the non-cooperative scenario. In this model, information sharing and organized harvesting typical of well-functioning cooperatives allowed fishers to optimize the use of the resource in terms of higher gonad yields per unit of effort while maintaining the productivity of the stock. This study also highlights the importance of community-based management (i.e., collaborative efforts in assessment, management, and governance of fisheries between fishers, scientists, and managers) toward improving fisheries sustainability.

Some 200 M people around the world, especially in coastal and island regions, depend on fishing and fish-related industries for their livelihoods. Finding the political will to change policies will be hard.

779,SOCIAL CAPITAL MOBILISATION THROUGH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANISATIONS FOR THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF RURAL-COMMONS: A STUDY ON 'KUDUMBASHREE',"Commons is a self-organised social system for managing common-pool resources, which refers to natural or man-made common goods like fishing grounds, forest and irrigation systems, etc. For the effective management of commons, the participants must have mutual trust and communication that can lead to collective action. Hence, social capital is important whereby community members communicate, cooperate and network to resolve any difficulties that come in the way of the common upright. The cost associated with this collective action in managing rural commons can be reduced by social capital. So, finding ways to strengthen the social capital of a community may be one key to solving the complications of the commons. The potential of microfinance enables the incorporation of the community by the collective action and creation of more sustainable community-based organisations. This paper seeks to draw the connection between group-based microfinance programmes, social capital and commons. It also pursues to empirically analyse how microfinance contributes to managing rural commons with reference to 'Kudumbashree,' a microfÃƒÂ¬nance-Ied financial security model of local economic development and women empowerment in Kerala. Neighbourhood Groups of Kudumbashree act as a meaningful agent in the creation and development of social capital and managing resources towards the objective of economic development and women empowerment.

A total of 66 fish species belong to 9 orders and 27 families were identified. Among these, almost 80% of the total fish population was from the orders, Siluriformes, Cypriniformes, and Perciformes. Fishes from the family Cyprinidae (22.71%) were found to be most abundant. Among 14 common groups of fishes identified, the highest contribution (28.79%) was from the catfishes. Ten vulnerable, eight endangered, and one critically endangered fish species were recorded. Alarmingly, based on their availability, 25 % and 18 % of the entire fish community were found to be rare and very rare, respectively.

The Vietnamese American community in the state of Mississippi is vulnerable to EH threats, but there is limited research on their risk perceptions. Understanding perceptions of risk and responsibility is important to manage EH risks and promote community resilience. This community-based participatory research study characterises Vietnamese American perceptions of EH risks, sources of information, and responsibility in coastal Mississippi. Five focus groups were conducted in 2016 and 2017 in Biloxi, Mississippi with Vietnamese Americans working in the seafood industry (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24) and mothers of children under the age of 18 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 25).

785,Biological criteria for municipal wastewater effluent monitoring programs,"As part of the long-term strategy for addressing issues related to municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), Environment Canada is developing environmental quality objectives (EQOs) for the aquatic receiving environment. Recommended biological monitoring components of the aquatic ecosystem include fish communities, benthic macroinvertebrate communities, sentinel fish species and primary producers (macrophytes, attached algae, phytoplankton). A set of criteria was developed for measurable attributes (indicators) of each of those components. Recommended numeric and narrative criteria could be used to determine when MWWE should be managed. Warning-level criteria for indices of benthic community composition are considered effects on indices of composition that deviate from the mean reference response by more than Ã‚Â±2 standard deviations. For sentinel fish population parameters, warning-level effects are considered >25% differences from reference in gonad or liver size, growth, or age, or a >10% change in condition factor. For primary producers, warning-level effects are considered those that coincide with anticipated changes in fish communities based on existing models. Where warning-level criteria are exceeded, it is recommended that monitoring be repeated at two- to three-year intervals. Where continued monitoring demonstrates an increase in the extent or magnitude of effects on indices of benthic community composition, or sentinel fish population parameters, it is recommended that effects be considered unacceptable and that the cause of effects be identified and managed. Losses of non-rare species or shifts in dominance are considered severe fish-community effects that should trigger management (i.e., identification and elimination of causative agents). Domination of the benthic community by one or a few tolerant taxa normally coincides with effects on fish communities, and should also be considered a severe effect that triggers management.

786,Assessing natural resource management through integrated environmental and social-economic accounting: The case of a Namibian conservancy,"Local natural resource management in its diverse manifestations holds core to its principles that the marginal and vulnerable households are empowered to manage valuable natural resources to improve social and economic equality and conserve biodiversity. Yet studies aiming to identify the impacts often show inconsistent results. Through constructing an integrated Environmental and Social Accounting Matrix (ESAM), we aim to assess how natural resources are used in different sectors and by different livelihoods, thus delivering different direct and indirect benefits to the community. The study was conducted in NamibiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sikunga Conservancy, which manages wildlife and fish resources in the Zambezi region. Our village-level ESAM shows an economic structure that strongly disadvantages remote households and identifies a small sector of the economy that benefits significantly from the use of natural resources.

788,Untangling the drivers of community cohesion in small-scale fisheries,"Sustainable fisheries require strong management and effective governance. However, small-scale fisheries (SSF) often lack formal institutions, leaving management in the hands of local users in the form of various governance approaches (e.g. local, traditional, or co-management). The effectiveness of these approaches inherently relies upon some level of cohesion among resource users to facilitate agreement on common policies and practices regarding common pool fishery resources. Understanding the factors driving the formation and maintenance of community cohesion in SSF is therefore critical if we are to devise more effective participatory governance approaches and encourage and empower decentralized, localized, and community-based resource management approaches. Here, we adopt a social relational network perspective to propose a suite of hypothesized drivers that lead to the establishment of social ties among fishers that build the foundation for community cohesion. We then draw on detailed data from JamaicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s small-scale fishery to empirically test these drivers by employing a set of nested exponential random graph models (ERGMs) based on specific structural building blocks (i.e. network configurations) theorized to influence the establishment of social ties. Our results demonstrate that multiple drivers are at play, but that collectively, gear-based homophily, geographic proximity, and leadership play particularly important roles. We discuss the extent to which these drivers help explain previous experiences, as well as their implications for future and sustained collective action in SSF in Jamaica and elsewhere.

789,"Mind the gap between aspiration and practice in co-managing marine protected areas: A case study from Negros Occidental, Philippines","A commonly held view is that co-management enhances the success of marine protected areas (MPA). The idea of co-management is to create a permanent forum in which a common strategy is initiated, negotiated and exercised in a collaborative way. It explicitly emphasizes the inclusion of wide ranging stakeholder interests and the attempt to balance those. The related literature maintains that the ideal state of co-management is a situation where government institutions and non-governmental stakeholders are equal partners. This study focuses on a co-management arrangement for a Philippine MPA from a critical perspective and systematically analyzes the formally granted rights of local fishers in co-management, and their actual influence on the management. The results show that, despite the legal stipulation of an equitable co-management arrangement including governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, the local fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ influence remains low. This discrepancy is mainly caused by i) flaws in the procedural rules of the co-management arrangement, ii) existing power imbalances emanating from local socio-political realities, and iii) drawbacks in non-governmental stakeholder organization and representation. Points of leverage are identified through which the legal design of co-management can be improved for helping to provide the grounds for equitable marine resource management in practice.

790,"Ecological changes in the coral reef communities of indonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bali barat national park, 2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2016","The coral reefs of Bali Barat National Park, one of IndonesiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest marine protected areas, are known for their high biodiversity and excellent sport diving; however, stressors such as destructive fishing practices, elevated water temperatures, damage from anchors and careless visitors have been observed on these reefs for decades. The purpose of this study was to document and quantify changes in the fish and stony coral community structure of reefs within and outside the boundaries of Bali Barat National Park from 2011 to 2016, including its most popular dive site, Menjangan Island. The results provide further knowledge about the reefs of NW Bali and the efficacy of current management practices, and they will inform management decisions for locally managed reef stewardship programs. Between 2011 and 2016 the reefs of NW Bali lost 44.4% of their living coral cover, declining from 36% to 20% overall cover. Mortality was principally attributed to thermal bleaching caused by persistently high sea temperatures, which peaked in January 2016 at 32.2Ã‚Â°C, coinciding with the third documented global bleaching event. Approximately one third of all stony corals were found to be bleached or recently dead. Despite the decline in coral cover, stony coral genus richness remained unchanged, with 56 genera recorded in both years, representing a combined total of 59 distinct genera. Mean fish biomass at Menjangan Island increased, with herbivorous fish biomass quadrupling, presumably due to decreased fishing effort at the island. The abundance of fish at all sitesÃ¢â‚¬â€both inside and outside the parkÃ¢â‚¬â€more than doubled, indicating a predominance of small fish at sites where fish biomass did not correspondingly rise. Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), not observed on transects in 2011, were found in 2016 in areas of relatively high disturbance from marine recreation and possible eutrophication from shrimp farm effluent and mainland runoff. Patterns of coral cover and damage, fish abundance and biomass, and lost fishing gear suggest that management activities inside and outside the park have reduced ecological damage. Local community conservation groups are practicing one or more of the following at Menjangan Island and in some of the locally managed conservation areas: installing moorings, removing coral predators (crown-of-thorns starfish and Drupella snails), reducing fishing pressure, securing live coral fragments back onto the reef and planting mangroves. These nature groups are raising community awareness about the importance of NW BaliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marine ecology to their economic and cultural wellbeing.

791,"Production trends, and challenges for biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries management of kaptai lake, the largest reservoir in bangladesh","Kaptai Lake (KL), the largest artificial lake in Bangladesh, supports an important inland open water fishery. Nevertheless, detailed studies on its fish diversity and environmental threats are still limited. Hence, a study was conducted to evaluate the current fish management scenarios, fish production, relative abundance to improve the production and biodiversity of KL. Data were collected from stakeholders through personal observation, focus group discussions, and cross-check interviews from September 2018 to July 2019. The fish production of KL increased from 1,200 metric tons (MT) in 1965Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1966 to 10,577 MT in 2018Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2019. The output of the lake was dominated by small fish remarkably, Gudusia chapra (Hamilton, 1822), Gonialosa manmina (Hamilton, 1822), and Corica soborna Hamilton, 1822, accounting for 64 % of the total production in 2018Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2019.

The study also identified that climate change and various human-driven causes threaten the fish production and biodiversity of this lake. These findings suggest that community-based fisheries management, protection of natural breeding grounds of carps, control of pollution, amendment of existing fishing laws, and collaborative research would be a necessary approach for mitigating the negative environmental impact of this lake.

792,How locally designed access and use controls can prevent the tragedy of the commons in a Mexican small-scale fishing community,"The Seri people, a self-governed community of small-scale fishermen in the Gulf of California, Mexico, have ownership rights to fishing grounds where they harvest highly valuable commercial species of bivalves. Outsiders are eager to gain access, and the community has devised a set of rules to allow them in. Because Seri government officials keep all the economic benefits generated from granting this access for themselves, community members create alternative entry mechanisms to divert those benefits to themselves. Under Hardin's model of the tragedy of the commons, this situation would eventually lead to the overexploitation of the fishery. The Seri people, however, are able to simultaneously maintain access and use controls for the continuing sustainability of their fishing grounds. Using insights from common-pool resources theory, I discuss how Seri community characteristics help mediate the conflict between collective action dilemmas and access and use controls.

793,Towards a more robust approach for the restoration of mangroves in Vietnam,"Key message: Globally, mangrove forests are under threat from a range of causes. They also represent a large potential form of climate mitigation and adaptation via reforestation, and this investment may contribute to restoration efforts and reverse mangrove decline. There has been significant (c. 200,000Ã‚Â ha) mangrove reforestation and restoration activity in Vietnam, and these projects provide indicators of the causes of project failure or success, and what is required for more complex restoration of ecosystem services. Failure in mangrove programs can be attributed to lack of understanding of the reasons for the loss of mangroves, poor site and species selection, and lack of incentives to engage local residents in the long-term management of restored areas. Overcoming these impediments and adopting monitoring and reporting procedures that consider both areal success and ecosystem function will provide a more robust approach for future mangrove restoration projects. Context: Over the last three decades there has been considerable (c. 200,000Ã‚Â ha) state and non-government investment in mangrove programs in Vietnam. The main objectives have been coastal protection and stabilization and the production of forest products, with fisheries, climate mitigation, and adaptation and ecosystem restoration as minor objectives. These have had reportedly varied success in terms of long-term survival rates. Much focus has been on the use of mono-species rather than restoring functioning mangrove ecosystems. Aims: This paper provides an overview of the status of mangroves in Vietnam and considers the effectiveness of mangrove restoration efforts based on an analysis of these reports. We develop and recommend approaches to make future mangrove restoration programs more effective. Result: First, we provide an overview of mangrove distribution and mangrove deforestation in Vietnam. Second, we analyse major mangrove projects by investigating their objectives and exploring reasons for their success or failure. Third, we suggest approaches for successful mangrove restoration activities in the context of current international agreements on climate change. Failure in some mangrove restoration programs in Vietnam can be attributed to lack of understanding of the reasons for the loss of mangroves and of site hydrology, poor site and species selection, lack of long-term monitoring and management, and lack of incentives to engage local communities in the long-term management of restored areas. Removal of these impediments will increase restoration success. Conclusion: The widespread and varied mangrove reforestation and restoration activities in Vietnam allow the analysis of different approaches and identification of the key factors leading to restoration success. These include care with species selection, having clear protocols for monitoring and reporting and implementing a co-management approach that provides incentives for local communities to benefit from the management of restored mangroves.

794,Protected nearshore shallow and deep subtidal rocky reef communities differ in their trophic diversity but not their nutritional condition,"Large physical changes that alter reef macrobenthos and fish assemblages occur with increasing depth, so the biological processes that regulate communities at different depths are expected to diverge. We used analyses of stable isotopes (ÃŽÂ´13C and ÃŽÂ´15N) and fatty acids to establish whether shallow (11Ã¢â‚¬â€œ25 m) and deep (45Ã¢â‚¬â€œ75 m) warm-temperate reef communities within a South African marine protected area differ in their trophic organisation and nutritional condition. We found evidence of enhanced nutritional condition in plankton from the deeper reef as compared with the shallow reef based on the essential fatty acid content, but this effect was generally not observed in the macrobenthos or the fish communities. Community-based indices derived from the stable isotope data indicated that the shallow-reef community had significantly greater niche diversification (greater diversity of carbon sources at the base of the food web) and more niche space occupied than the deep-reef community. One obvious difference in available carbon sources between reef communities was the absence of benthic primary production on the deep reef, where light is limiting. Our results highlight that the decreased trophic diversity, and to an extent functional redundancy, associated with the simplification of food webs at depth may translate into greater vulnerability of deep reefs to disturbance.

Our objective was to examine the pattern of lifestyle factors associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Grenada and to determine whether the prevalence of CVD risk factors differs by subgroups. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult Grenadians between 2005 and 2007. We used a population-wide, community-based approach by adapting the World Health Organization's STEPwise Approach to the Surveillance of Chronic Disease survey for a local context. We collected behavioral, anthropometric, and blood sample data to assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors. Results: An estimated 64% (n = 2,017) of 3,167 eligible adults participated in our study (60% women). With increasing age, consumption of fried foods declined, whereas fish intake increased. Adults aged 45 to 54 years had the highest obesity rate (39%). Large waist circumference was more common among women than among men. According to National Cholesterol Education Program criteria, 29% of participants had metabolic syndrome (47% Ã¢â€°Â¥65 y; 36% women vs 17% men). Approximately one-fifth of participants had lived outside Grenada for more than 10 years.

797,A comparison of social outcomes associated with different fisheries co-management institutions,"Collaborative management (often referred to as co-management) is increasingly being used to promote sustainability, equity, compliance, and other desirable outcomes in fisheries. However, little is known about how these outcomes are related to specific institutional arrangements (such as the types of rules in use and the forums for developing those rules). Here, we surveyed 960 resource users from 42 communities across five countries to examine how people's perceptions of livelihood and compliance outcomes are related to the: (1) number of rules in use; (2) specific configurations of rules; and (3) type of co-management arrangement in place. We found that perceived compliance was lower when >2 rules were in use, suggesting that the complexity of regulations can hinder compliance. Additionally, we found that resource users under locally managed protected areas and customary management arrangements were more likely to perceive beneficial livelihood outcomes than users under national park and devolved governance arrangements.

798,Community-based environmental education in the fishing villages of Tuticorin and its role in conservation of the environment,"The coastal town of Tuticorin is situated in the southern part of the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park on the Southeastern Indian coast. The four islands off the Tuticorin coast are fringed by corals reefs and seagrass beds. Destructive fishing methods including blast fishing, near-shore trawling, coral mining, sedimentation and pollution have, however, caused considerable damage to the coral reefs and seagrass beds, threatening the reef fisheries of the region. A significant portion of the fisher folk in the 23 coastal villages along the Tuticorin coast, due to low literacy levels and lack of other employment, is dependent on the dwindling fish catches in and around these reefs and seagrass beds. Crowded fishing grounds, increasing demand for fisheries' products and declining catches compel fishers to increase the use of more effective and destructive fishing methods. Adult education was introduced in five coastal villages (Rajapalayam, Siluvaipatti, Arockiyapuram, Tirespuram and Inigo Nagar) on the Tuticorin coast in 2007. Included in this adult education, environmental education practices, including conservation of natural resources, particularly coral reefs and seagrass habitats, its importance and role, the need for conservation and management, eco-friendly fishing practices and sustainable use of fishery resources, were taught to the fisher folk in all five coastal villages. The trained fisher folk play key roles in their respective villages in awareness creation about the conservation of natural resources. The campaign during International Year of the Reef in 2008 helped to make aware many people in the villages about the importance of corals and associated seagrass and other resources. As a part of mitigating climate change impacts and income generation, family members of the five villages were also taught and helped to increase plantation.",NA,No,"The study is conducted in India, not in any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is based on a case study from Tuticorin, which is in India, not in any of the countries listed in the SC.

799,Local perceptions of environmental changes in fishing communities of southwest Madagascar,"Southwest Madagascar is a region that is significantly impacted upon by climate change. As in a lot of developing countries, the livelihoods of many communities in this region are dependent on fishing. This makes these communities particularly vulnerable to climate-related changes. We conducted a survey in two coastal fishing communities in the Toliara Province, Ambola and Ambotsibotsike. Using a free listing exercise, semi-structured interviews and focus group methods, we documented local perceptions of environmental changes and responses to changes. Results were compared, taking into account the differences in the degree of remoteness, market exposure and religiosity. Time periods that respondents reported as having had a high degree of change were compared to time periods of historical records of cyclones occurring in Toliara Province. Mostly, changes in the environment were said to have started 21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ40 years ago. An overlap was observed between time periods when respondents observed changes in their environment and time periods of high magnitude cyclones. Answers relating to the local environment show that both villages identify with a sea culture, but the local ecological knowledge is arguably more accurate in the remote village of Ambola. In Ambotsibotsike God's intervention was predominantly identified as the source/cause of changes in the natural environment. Ambola also displayed a higher proportion of household members who participate in fishing from pirogues (at least one person per household). In both villages, the most reported change was a reduction of sea resources (64,2% of the answers in Ambola and 69.5% in Ambotsibotsike). Villagers' adaptation responses reflected the presence of NGOs in both villages. This influence was particularly strong in Ambola, where the establishment of reserves was found to be a predominant strategy to cope with change (54.8% of the answers). Our study provides additional insights that can be used in relation to the discussion of the role of the market, of religion, and the influence of NGOs on local knowledge. It seeks to contribute to the need to implement sustainable conservation strategies and successful community-based management plans.

800,"Evaluating the feasibility and impact of a yoga intervention on cognition, physical function, physical activity, and affective outcomes in people living with HIV: Protocol for a randomized pilot trial","Background: Despite lower mortality rates due to combination antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV (PLWH) are grappling with increasingly complex health issues, including cognitive impairments in areas such as memory, attention, processing speed, and motor function. Yoga has been shown to be an effective form of exercise and mindfulness-based stress reduction for many clinical populations. However, no randomized trials have evaluated the impact of yoga on cognitive and physical function among PLWH. Objective: The aim of this pilot randomized trial was to determine the feasibility of a yoga intervention to lay the groundwork for a full-scale, multisite, community-based trial for PLWH. Specific objectives are to (1) assess the feasibility of study protocol and procedures, (2) compare cognition in the yoga group with the usual care control group after 12 weeks of the intervention in PLWH, and (3) compare the effects of the 12-week yoga intervention versus control on balance, walking speed, physical activity, mental health, medication adherence, and quality of life among PLWH. Methods: We propose a pilot randomized trial with 2 parallel groups (yoga versus control). We will recruit 25 PLWH (>35 years) from community and health organizations in Halifax, Canada. After baseline assessment with blinded assessors, participants will be randomly assigned to the yoga or control group, using a random computer generator. Participants in the yoga group will engage in supervised 60-min group-based yoga sessions 3 times a week for 12 weeks at a yoga studio. Participants in the control group will maintain their current physical activity levels throughout the study. Results: As per the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension for pilot studies, means of all outcomes, mean change, and 95% CIs will be calculated for each group separately. Two-tailed independent t tests and Fisher exact tests will be used to compare groups at baseline. We will analyze quantitative postintervention questionnaire responses using Chi-square tests, and open-ended responses will be analyzed thematically. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be used to analyze secondary variables. Changes in outcome variables will be examined between groups and within groups. Effect sizes will be reported for each outcome. A priori adherence and satisfaction criteria will be met if participants attend >70% of the yoga sessions and if >70% of the participants are satisfied with the intervention as determined by a postparticipation questionnaire. Study enrollment began in January 2018, with results expected for October 2019. Conclusions: This pilot randomized trial will be the first to investigate the feasibility and effect of a yoga intervention on cognitive and physical outcomes among PLWH. This work will inform the feasibility of further investigations in terms of capacity building, participant recruitment and retention, and assessment and intervention protocols.

801,The Effect of Short-Term Upwelling Events on Fish Assemblages at the South-Eastern Coast of the Baltic Sea,"Multiple stressors, such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, biological invasions etc., are affecting fish communities, and thus can have versatile effects on marine ecosystems and socio-economic activities as well. Understanding the changes in the fish community structure is ecologically and economically important, yet a very complex issue, requiring comprehensive analysis of multiple factors. The role of regional oceanographic variability, namely, coastal upwelling, is often neglected when it comes to the analysis of fish assemblages. In this perspective, we were aiming, for the first time in the Baltic Sea, to assess the upwelling influence on fish communities and fish community-based ecological indices used under Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The study covered a long-term period (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2019) for upwelling identified by satellite data analysis and fish gillnet surveys, performed in three distinct locations in the coastal waters of the SE Baltic Sea. Overall, our study revealed that temporal dynamics of fish abundance and community composition were associated with the presence of coastal upwelling. The study outcomes suggest that the fish community was more diverse and a higher number of some fish species was observed before upwelling. During upwelling, there was more evident dominance of 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2 main marine fish species. Through the changes in fish abundance and species composition upwelling was also responsible for the changes in fish community structure-based indices for marine environment status, i.e., in the majority of the cases a decrease in Trophic, Piscivorous Fish, and Diversity indices were observed. Our study demonstrates that upwelling can affect both, the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of coastal fish communities, therefore, it is important to consider this when predicting shifts in the distribution of fish stocks or assessing environmental status indicators, especially under changing climate. We believe that our approach adds novel information to the study of coastal ecosystems of the Baltic Sea and is important for better management of socio-economic activities in the coastal zone.

803,"Creating a place for ""community"" in new England fisheries","Although the Sustainable Fisheries Act that amended the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1996 defined fishing communities to be places with significant harvesting and/or processing activities, a collaborative mapping project in the Northeast has made clear the limits of such a port-based definition by documenting the presence and nature of communities ""at sea."" Using vessel trip report data, unique maps depicting community territories were created for a variety of communities dependent upon Gulf of Maine fisheries. Community-based researchers interviewed fishermen from the region and asked them to engage with the maps, discuss the nature of community within those ""at sea"" locations, and document the type of local environmental knowledge they maintained. The participatory interviews made clear the varied ways that communities respond to and are changed by the recent history of regulatory and environmental change. While the dominant port-based vision of fishing communities sees communities as sites of impact and decline, a focus on relationships between fishermen and between fishermen and their environments reveals communities as ongoing and emerging processes. While the former produces doubt relative to the development of any community-based initiatives for fisheries management, the latter points to the resilience of ""community"" and the always-emerging potential for community-based approaches.

804,Governance in vulnerability assessment: The role of globalising decision-making networks in determining local vulnerability and adaptive capacity,"Community-based vulnerability assessment has often assumed that the local is the relevant level of adaptation to climate change. This paper suggests that not only do a number of levels from the international to the regional influence which adaptations can take place locally, but the governance network that is made up by actors on different levels may to a large extent be formed in responses to globalising factors, such as internationalisation of economies and the changing role of the state. The paper presents a study of adaptation in reindeer (Rangifier tarandus) herding, forestry and fishing communities in northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland, with a focus on assessing stakeholders' own perceptions of environmental, socio-political and economic factors that affect them. In general, the paper illustrates the integration of non-subsistence economies into large and complex interactions where local adaptation is a result of the sum of stresses impacting individual entrepreneurs, and the potential they have to adapt their practices given governance (and their access to support) on different scales.

A multi-level logistic regression was fit to analyse the use of these strategies, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, education, neighbourhood deprivation and neighbourhood population turnover (a proxy for neighbourhood social capital). A cross-level interaction term was included for education and neighbourhood deprivation. Lower Super Output Area was used as the geographical scale for the areal unit of analysis.Results:Significant neighbourhood effects were observed for use of 'slimming clubs', 'healthy eating' and 'increasing exercise' as weight management strategies, independent of individual- and area-level covariates. A significant interaction between education and neighbourhood deprivation was observed across all strategies, suggesting that as an area becomes more deprived, individuals of the lowest education are more likely not to use any strategy compared with those of the highest education.Conclusions:Neighbourhoods modify/amplify individual disadvantage and social inequalities, with individuals of low education disproportionally affected by deprivation. It is important to include neighbourhood-based explanations in the development of community-based policy interventions to help tackle obesity.

808,Engaging Fisherfolk Organizations in Conservation-Based Alternative Livelihoods and Conservation of the Habitats of Irrawaddy Dolphins in Negros Occidental,"The coastal waters of Bago City and Pulupandan are core habitats of the critically endangered Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), and the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA) is seen as a crucial strategy in ensuring their conservation. However, the sustainability of the MPA depends on the participation of those who have greater stakes as resource users, the fisherfolk communities. This paper describes and assays the experiences and issues on how fisherfolk organizations were engaged in conservation-based alternative livelihood and protection of the habitats of Irrawaddy dolphins. Using qualitative methods, rapid community appraisal, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and workshops were conducted involving eight fisherfolk organizations. A conservation-based alternative livelihood framework was adopted in engaging the fisherfolk communities, which was drawn from the concepts of the sustainable alternative livelihoods approach (SALA) and the ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). Community organizing processes and development principles were observed, such as ensuring that activities are undertaken to be participatory and community-based in approaches. The experiences in engaging fisherfolk organizations yielded some issues and lessons: poverty remains a barrier to conservation; how to contend with the strong dole-out mentality among members; community building as an organizing approach was short-lived; the support of local government units; and the vital role of women in conservation and community development. The study suggests a shift in the community organizing approach towards consensus organizing because environmental conservation necessitates the involvement of various stakeholders.

809,"A Bayesian belief network model for community-based coastal resource management in the Kei Islands, Indonesia","Understanding the specific relationships between ecological and socioeconomic conditions and marine tenure is likely to contribute to successful functioning of self-governance institutions for common-pool resources. Complex interrelationships of factors influencing fishing activities of coastal communities and implementation of customary marine tenure over their waters can be represented in a Bayesian belief network model. We developed a Bayesian belief network model that includes the links between factors for fishing communities in the Kei Islands in Indonesia, based on indepth local surveys. Our results showed that the cumulative impacts of multiple factors on key social, economic, and environmental outcomes can be much larger than the impact from a single source, which implies that management or policy intervention could be more effective when addressing multiple factors simultaneously. The local community's perception of fish stock abundance trends was the single most important factor influencing social, economic, and environmental outcomes of their community-based management system. The frequency of which outsiders were sighted in territorial waters was strongly (negatively) linked to weak or strong implementation of a customary tenure (Sasi) and the occurrence of intervillage and intravillage conflict. Ecological variables also drive these conflicts, which illustrates the close connection between ecological and social outcomes, and the importance of considering social-ecological systems as a whole.

810,Techniques for education in community medicine,"The term ""Community Medicine"" is used to refer to practicing medicine in thecommunity, to public health efforts, or to medical practice that incorporates public healthconcepts and an understanding of the patients' community (Fisher, 2003; Plescia, Konen & Lincourt, 2002; Ricketts, 1973). This chapter addresses the last definition. The field ofpediatrics has a similar definition for community medicine. The American Academy ofPediatrics (AAP) defines ""Community Pediatrics"" as ""a synthesis of clinical practice andpublic health principles directed toward providing health care to a given child andpromoting the health of all children within the context of the family, school, andcommunity (Rushton, 2005, pp1092).""We are becoming progressively more aware of how community and socioeconomicfactors impact health (Wood, 2003; Social Deteminants of Health, 2009). In response,there is increased recognition of the need to train medical students and residents inCommunity Medicine by medical schools, primary care residencies and primary careprofessional organizations (AAFP, 2009; Rushton, 2005). Although the Pediatric andFamily Medicine Residency Review Committees have a long history of requiringcommunity and advocacy experiences for their residents (ACGME ProgramRequirements for Graduate Medical Education in Pediatrics, 2007; ACGME ProgramRequirements for Graduate Medical Education in Family Medicine, 2007), evidenceshows that resident knowledge of their patients' communities can be poor (Northrip,Bush, Li, Marsh, Chen, & Guagliardo, 2012).Multiple techniques have been studied to improve trainees understanding of theirpatients' communities and the interplay between those communities and health. These include exposure to communities through driving tours or scavenger hunts, contact withlegislators, and work with community partners (Bortot, Culberson, Modak, Becan-McBride, & Neiman, 2004; Plescia et al., 2002; Solomon, Minkovitz, Grason, &Carraccio, 2007), Some programs have experiences such as rotations in community-basedclinics and community-based projects (Fisher et al., 2003; Plescia, et al., 2002; Bortot etal., 2004; Shope, Bradley, & Tarat, 1999) . Other strategies include Community OrientedPrimary Care, inclusion of community based multidisciplinary team members in training,and community-based residency programs or tracks (Chen, Lichtenstein, Northrip, &Horn, 2010; Hufford, West, Paterniti & Pan, 2009; Plescia et al., 2002). As demandsincrease to reduce health disparities and improve preventative health measures,community medicine training efforts will likely increase in the future.

811,An interdisciplinary evaluation of community-based TURF-reserves,"Coastal marine ecosystems provide livelihoods for small-scale fishers and coastal communities around the world. Small-scale fisheries face great challenges since they are difficult to monitor, enforce, and manage, which may lead to overexploitation. Combining territorial use rights for fisheries (TURF) with no-take marine reserves to create TURF-reserves can improve the performance of small-scale fisheries by buffering fisheries from environmental variability and management errors, while ensuring that fishers reap the benefits of conservation investments. Since 2012, 18 old and new community-based Mexican TURFreserves gained legal recognition thanks to a regulation passed in 2012; their effectiveness has not been formally evaluated. We combine causal inference techniques and the Social- Ecological Systems framework to provide a holistic evaluation of community-based TURFreserves in three coastal communities in Mexico. We find that, overall, reserves have not yet achieved their stated goals of increasing the density of lobster and other benthic invertebrates, nor increasing lobster catches. A lack of clear ecological and socioeconomic effects likely results from a combination of factors. First, some of these reserves might be too young for the effects to show (reserves were 6-10 years old). Second, the reserves are not large enough to protect mobile species, like lobster. Third, variable and extreme oceanographic conditions have impacted harvested populations. Fourth, local fisheries are already well managed, and while reserves may protect populations within its boundaries, it is unlikely that reserves might have a detectable effect in catches. However, even small reserves are expected to provide benefits for sedentary invertebrates over longer time frames, with continued protection. These reserves may provide a foundation for establishing additional, larger marine reserves needed to effectively conserve mobile species.

812,"Promoting Sustainable Smallholder Aquaculture Productivity Through Landscape and Seascape Aquapark Models: A Case Study of Busia County, Kenya","The dwindling capture fisheries has triggered an increase in Kenya's annual fish demand deficit, currently estimated at 553,000 MT. With the adoption of sustainable policies, aquaculture can bridge and surpass this deficit. Kenya's fish farming environment is however characterized by its highly fragmented production farms, which limit the dynamism and technical change needed to commercialize aquaculture. The global trend in the commercialization of food production is through the consolidation of farmlands. For example, most farms in the United States of America were also once small, but because of the policy of land consolidation, the farmlands average 1,000 acres. Over the past decade, much of Sub-Saharan African nations are experiencing a rise of 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ100 hectares except in Kenya, where the laws have exacerbated the situation. Amid declining agricultural productivity, farm-level efficiency and food security problems, land fragmentation is emerging as a key policy question in Kenya and is the single largest bottleneck, to aquaculture growth in Busia. A paradigm shift in the aquaculture development policy will enable aggregated production of fish under a fragmented land tenure. This study discusses the need to remodel the current fragmented and uncoordinated cluster-based smallholder aquaculture development strategy by adopting a hybrid aquapark concept. In this concept, the aggregated smallholder aquaparks are established and managed through specialized management service provision units and linked to adjacent smallholder aquaculture production clusters with a community-based coordination and support framework. The study further gives the application and socioeconomic experiences of the pilot aquapark concept of aquaculture development in Busia County. The aquapark model coupled with the deliberate establishment of aquaculture-enabling infrastructure has enhanced the efficiency, profitability, and productivity of aquaculture production. The realization of smallholder community-owned large-scale fish farms through aquaparks offers a window for dynamism and technical change necessary for the commercialization of aquaculture under a fragmented land tenure system.

813,"Developing sustainable salmon management in Willapa Bay, Washington","This article describes a communityÃ¢â‚¬Âbased approach to salmon restoration and management in Willapa Bay, Washington. Willapa Bay is an area rich in natural resources, historically oriented toward extraction activities, and with increasing threats to its fishery resource. Members of the community have rejected the traditional blend of agency and industry decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking control over the resource and are conducting a process that includes a diverse set of participants. The article describes the process as it nears the end of the planning phase and beginning of the implementation phase of salmon restoration. It identifies obstacles to achieving sustainable salmon management, including lack of coordination and consistency among fishery managers, limited participation by important stakeholder groups that leads to political roadblocks, and unavailability of important scientific and socioeconomic data and analysis.

814,"Using the Diversity, Taxonomic and Functional Attributes of a Zooplankton Community to Determine Lake Environmental Typology in the Natural Southern Boreal Lakes (QuÃƒÂ©bec, Canada)","Herein, we used zooplankton as a study model for determining how biodiversity components as well as taxonomic and functional attributes reflect lake typology in the natural southern boreal lakes. We estimated the regional and local variation in zooplankton diversity and the community structure across a set of fourteen lakes within a national park. Regional diversity (ÃŽÂ³ diversity) accounted for 40 species including 20 rotifers, 10 cladocerans and 8 copepods. Local diversity (ÃŽÂ± diversity) averaged 15 species per lake. Spatial variation in ÃŽÂ² diversity was inversely related to spatial variation in ÃŽÂ± diversity. Inter-lake variation in zooplankton communities based on taxonomy, functional traits and biotic indices was explained by two major limnological gradients: namely lake trophic status and fish community. The community structure reflected a gradient of rotifer to calanoid copepod dominance in response to trophic status. Several key species of rotifers (Kellicottia longispina and Conochilus unicornis) and of small (Bosmina and Diaphanosoma birgei) or large (Daphnia catawba and Holopedium gibberum cf glacialis) cladocerans were good indicators of lake zooplankton typology, as in other boreal lakes. We distinguished two main groups of lakes: (1) oligotrophic lakes inhabited by brook trout and dominated by the calanoid copepods and (2) mesotrophic lakes inhabited by northern pike and dominated by rotifers. Overall, our study can help managers better define monitoring and conservation strategies for lake ecosystems in natural parks. Ã‚Â© 2022 by the authors.

815,Lessons in co-management from beach seine and lobster fisheries in Grenada,"The beach seine fishery for small coastal pelagic fish at Gouyave and the spiny lobster fishery at Sauteurs were two Grenada coastal co-management initiatives under the Caribbean Coastal Co-management Guidelines Project. This project, implemented by the Caribbean Conservation Association (CCA) from 2001 to 2003, aimed at identifying and promoting the conditions for successful coastal co-management in the Caribbean. The lobster study provided lessons on interactions among government stakeholders, and between them and fishers, where a co-management solution to conflict over irresponsible and illegal fishing was sought. Lessons from the beach seine study focused on why fishers wished to propose formal legal procedures based on traditional fishing rules as an alternative to customary, community-based management measures for resolving conflicts. This paper illustrates the challenges of introducing coastal resource co-management in the Caribbean, using as example the lobster fishery in Grenada. Guidelines for enhancing the chances of successful co-management are presented and emphasis is placed on promoting comprehensive capacity building. Ã‚Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

817,"Vulnerable people, vulnerable resources? Exploring the relationship between peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vulnerability and the sustainability of community-managed natural resources","Participatory approaches to the management of common-pool resources (CPRs) are built on the premise that resource-users are dependent on the productivity of the resource and therefore have the incentive to act as resource stewards if empowered to do so. Yet many CPR users have only temporary interest in using the resources. Moreover, they are vulnerable to a range of stressors and risks unrelated to resource access and sustainability concerns. Both of these may undermine such incentives. Furthermore, discounting theory posits that high vulnerability shortens time horizons so that vulnerable CPR users might be expected to heavily discount future benefits from resource conservation. We present an ethnographic study carried out in two communities on Lake Victoria, Uganda, where fisher folk face a range of elevated risks to health and security. These immediate risks undermine participatory fishery management but this does not necessarily indicate inherently short time-horizons; for many, fishing and fish-trading are not perceived as a life-long occupation but as a means to generate capital for investment in other businesses. Thus, whether they are vulnerable or not, it cannot simply be assumed that current CPR users will have a long-term interest in participating in resource management. Incentivizing participation in CPR management for long-term sustainability may have to address both peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wider vulnerabilities and aspirations. Ã‚Â© 2014 The Author(s).

819,"Community organizing theory and practice : Conservative trends, oppositional alternatives","ACORN is an example of an organization that is working against the current. It has over many years sustained its stance as an organization that contests inequalities, and it mobilizes through its organizations people directly affected to struggle against those inequalities. It is part of a minority of community organizations that have continued in this tradition. In contrast, many community-based efforts have abandoned these traditions, learned to accommodate to the changing context, and as a consequence have become depoliticized, highly professional service providers and local developers, supported in these roles by government and private foundations. Some readers may not even consider such work as community organizing, for these groups stand outside the major neo- Alinskyite networks and related smaller efforts (Fisher 1994). But they do include such community-based efforts as social service providers, community development corporations, economic development initiatives, and the like, which are most vulnerable and open to corporatized funding pressures. Nevertheless, even the large community organizing networks are affected by pressures of moderation and incorporation. In this chapter, we will examine some of these transitions, present and critique some of the ideas that have supported it, and then look comparatively at alternative organizing practices that help efforts sustain their challenges to the wider contemporary political economy and its moderating pressures on progressive social change organizations. This study argues that most community-based efforts have adapted to the moderating pressures of our constrained context for social change. An emphasis on ""the bottom line,"" building ""partnerships"" with local businesses and corporations, developing ""relationships,"" and focusing on ""community assets"" has narrowed conceptions of community activism, for example, squeezing out conflict models from the community orga nizer's arsenal of strategies and tactics. Moreover, most contemporary models of community building and development focus exclusively on the local internal community, not the economic, political, and social decisions that rest outside the community and create community needs and concerns. There is a greater emphasis on social consensus, as opposed to conflict, and service provision as opposed to action. In our previous work, we have analyzed the growing moderation of community organizing and development in the current neoliberal context (Fisher and Shragge 2000; DeFilippis, Fisher, and Shragge 2006). Others have come to similar conclusions. For example, Saegert (2006) argues that in contrast to older models of community activism, the newer approaches emphasize ""relationships, coalitions, and consensus building and voluntary, often entrepreneurial action. . . . Community building added a human, relational and civic component. . . . Unlike power organizing, it emphasized cooperation, mutual gain among different sectors of society"" (275). In her critical discussion, she elaborates: ""Community builders downplay differences in self or group interest and structural and historical factors that create and maintain economic and political inequality. . . . They seek to nurture a broad range of overlapping social networks within which different combinations of individuals and organizations can reach a consensus about the achievement of particular goals"" (279). In their discussion of Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Gittell and Vidal (1998) argue that local organizations have disengaged from fighting at the national level and focused on local politics in order to achieve concrete and sustainable outcomes. Their definition of resident commitment includes ""commonly described measures of social capital, such as loyalty to community, and levels of trust and cooperation among residents"" (24-25). Certainly, there are positive results and progressive adaptations to the pressures of moderation (Saegert, Thompson, and Warren 2001), but the corporatization of the nonprofit world has reached deeply into the CBO (community-based organization) sector, and none are immune to its pressures (Fabricant and Fisher 2002).

821,Methodological rigour in assessing participatory development,"There have been few rigorous assessments of the effectiveness of participatory processes for natural resource management. In Bangladesh an approach known as Participatory Action Plan Development (PAPD) has been developed and applied. By combining problem identification and solution analysis by separate stakeholder groups with plenary sessions it is claimed to result in consensus and more effective community based management. Methodological issues in assessing the effectiveness of such development are discussed and good practice illustrated. Under the same project there were sites where PAPD had been used and others without its use so a comparative assessment could be made. However, for an appropriate assessment it is important to identify clear testable hypotheses regarding the expected benefits, appropriate measures, and other factors which may affect or confound the outcome. The paper illustrates how participatory assessment involving both individual opinions and focus groups can be systematically recorded, quantified and used with other data in statistical analysis. By using statistical modelling methods at an appropriate level of aggregation and controlling for other factors, benefits from PAPD were found to be significant. The systematic approaches and practices recommended from this example can be applied in similar situations to test the effectiveness of participatory processes using participatory assessments.

Seven fish families made up nine fish species, with their local names, were recorded. The fish species Tilapia zillii, a cichlid was the most dominant with a total value of 3,342 and 22.87% in terms of numbers and percentage abundance respectively. The Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, with 13.08% percentage abundance, was the species of the highest market value. Thirty-six artisanal fishers (all part time) with fourteen canoes, using gill nets, cast nets, basket traps, drum traps, hook and line set and Malian trap as fishing gears were recorded in the river with a total catch of 14,611 in terms of numbers and a mean catch of 43 fishes/canoe. Based on the catch composition, the river was productive and comparable with other smaller but productive Nigeria Rivers, reservoirs and lakes. The Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) system was suggested for management consideration, with emphasis on registration of fishers and their fishing equipment, enforcement of minimum mesh size of 3 inch and establishment of community based cooperative scheme.

823,Insights in public health: Community strengthening through canoe culture: Ho'omana'o Mau as method and metaphor,"Historical trauma occurs across generations and is evidenced by indigenous disparities. Efforts made to address this issue commonly utilize European ethnocentric methods. Rather, a community-based approach should be used to empower indigenous communities. God's Country Waimanalo (GCW) is a grassroots organization developed by Native Hawaiians for Native Hawaiians.

824,The Okavango: Whose Delta is it?,"The Okavango Delta is amongst the largest Ramsar sites (http://www.ramsar.org/sitelist.pdf) in the world and an important wetland for community livelihoods, conservation and tourism in Botswana. Over the years, the utilization of the delta has shifted from communal use to state control, with an increased use for conservation and tourism. This increased use for conservation and tourism has manifested in the physical expansion of the conservation area - Moremi Game Reserve and the formation of Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) around the reserve, whose primary land use is wildlife utilization. The expansion of the conservation area has translated into several practical matters, including expansion of the area for non-hunting activities or photographic areas. The livelihoods of local communities of the Okavango delta who depended on fishing, hunter-gathering, livestock rearing, rain-fed agriculture and flood recession farming have been negatively affected by the expansion of conservation and tourism in the delta. The livelihoods alternatives in the form of Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) and tourism have not provided substitutes for the people as the communities are still reliant on the same old livelihood sources as in the past, albeit within smaller and restricted areas. This paper explores the ownership of the natural resources within the Okavango Delta. It asks and attempts to answer the following questions: Who owns and controls the use of the land? Who has access to other resources there in? Who makes the decisions on how the delta resources should be managed and used? Who benefits from the delta resources? We argue firstly that ownership of the delta as defined by legal parameters and demonstrated in natural resource management practice is vested on government. Secondly, government, after assuming ownership of the delta continues to sell its stake to the international community, at the expense of local ownership and access to resources. We conclude that in the process the ability of local communities to source a livelihood out of the delta as they previously used to, is compromised. This we argue works against the goal of sustainable development for improved livelihoods as proclaimed in government policy documents. Ã‚Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

825,Community-based conservation results in the recovery of reef fish spawning aggregations in the Coral Triangle,"In the Coral Triangle community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) are being established at a prolific rate. Their establishment can benefit both fisheries and biodiversity, and they provide both a socially and economically acceptable means of managing coral reefs in developing nations. However, because such MPAs are typically small (usually &lt;0.5km2), they will rarely provide protection to large mobile fishes. An exception to this limitation may exist when community-based MPAs are established to protect small sites where vital processes occur, such as fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). To test the effectiveness of small (0.1-0.2km2) MPAs for protecting FSAs, we monitored three FSA sites where brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus) aggregate to spawn. Sites were monitored during peak reproductive periods (several days prior to each new moon) between January 2005 and November 2009. All three sites are located in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, and had been exploited for decades, but in 2004 two sites were protected by the establishment of community-based MPAs. The third site continued to be exploited. Over the monitoring period densities of E. fuscoguttatus and E. polyphekadion increased at both MPAs, but not at the site that remained open to fishing. At one MPA the densities of E. polyphekadion increased tenfold.

826,Enabling conditions for community-based comanagement of marine protected areas in the United States,"Comanagement is recognized, practiced, and recommended as an effective, equitable approach to place-based protection of marine resources. Despite acknowledged benefits and its potential for improved management outcomes, in the U.S., comanagement of marine protected areas (MPAs) is a relatively new approach, with limited applications. This paper reveals social, ecological and institutional conditions that enabled, or hindered, development of comanagement as an outcome of collaborative processes undertaken by community-based actors and state-based resource managers in three U.S. MPA case studies. A mixed method design, consisting of a literature review, in-depth interviews and document analysis was used to analyze MPAs in HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi, California and Florida where: (1) comanagement systems have developed between state government and community-based partners, (2) protected area boundaries and objectives are clearly defined, and, (3) marine habitat protection is a primary management objective. Eight enabling conditions were present in all three cases. Four of these conditions were consistent with preconditions identified in a published conceptual framework for comanagement arrangements synthesized from the literature and direct observations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an opportunity for negotiation, a legally mandated or brokered incentive, a willingness by local users to contribute, and leadership. Four more enabling conditions emerged from this study Ã¢â‚¬â€œ connection to place, a capacity crisis, government willingness to partner, and a clear and just process. As managers strive to protect marine ecosystem function in the face of chronic environmental stressors and limited government support for environmental protection, applying these findings to leverage conditions that enable comanagement can help build community-based capacity to effectively manage MPAs.

827,Impact of aquaculture field school on community fish farming,"Community based aquaculture, a subset of the rural aquaculture, is characterised with low fish production level. Sustainable improvement of productivity levels in such resources has remained a challenge. The study adopted a novel approach of technology transfer through aquaculture field school which involves provision of technical advices and no physical inputs. The article tries to capture its impact on fish production levels and economics of community based aquaculture. The study was conducted during 2009-2012 in Khurda and Puri districts of Odisha by surveying randomly selected farmers of community ponds. Demonstration, need-based skill training, field days, workshops and field visits were organised periodically for fish farmers involved in community based aquaculture management. In order to study the impact of technical inputs, data were collected from 31 randomly selected village community ponds. Farmers provided with technical advices could improve pond management practices significantly (p&lt;0.05). This included eradication of aquatic weeds, removal of weeds and predatory fishes, enhancing pond productivity, stocking fingerlings and/or yearlings, partially feeding fish with locally available feed. This has resulted in better fish production (@ 2192 kg ha-1yr-1) than pre-project period (@1081 kg ha-1yr-1). Motivational drive, need based technical advice and follow up action brought behavioral change in fish farmers for higher investment for intensification of pond management. Average expenditure in community based aquaculture rose significantly (p&lt;0.05) from $40146 ha-1yr-1 to $87071 ha-1yr-1. Average net returns from community ponds at the end of the project period increased to $95068 ha-1 yr-1 against $34057 ha-1yr-1. Ã‚Â© 2016 Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute.

828,"A randomized trial to assess retention rates using mobile phone reminders versus physical contact tracing in a potential HIV vaccine efficacy population of fishing communities around Lake Victoria, Uganda","Background: High retention (follow-up) rates improve the validity and statistical power of outcomes in longitudinal studies and the effectiveness of programs with prolonged administration of interventions. We assessed participant retention in a potential HIV vaccine trials population of fishing communities along Lake Victoria, Uganda. Methods: In a community-based individual randomized trial, 662 participants aged 15-49 years were randomized to either mobile phone or physical contact tracing reminders and followed up at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 18 post-enrolment. The visit schedules aimed at mimicking a vaccine efficacy trial representing an early interval (months 1-6) where most vaccinations would be administered and a later period of post-vaccination follow-up. The primary outcome was retention measured as the proportion of post-baseline follow up visits completed by a participant. Retention was estimated in early and later follow-up intervals, and overall for all the six follow-up visits. Adjusted differences in retention between the study arms were determined by multivariable logistic regression using StataÃ‚Â® 14. One participant was later dropped from the analysis because of age ineligibility discovered after enrolment. Results: Of the expected total follow up visits of 3966 among 661 participants, 84.1% (3334) were attained; 82.1% (1626/1980) in the phone arm and 86% (1708/1986) in the physical tracing arm (p = 0.001). No statistically significant differences in retention were observed between the study arms in the first 6 months but thereafter, retention was significantly higher for physical contact reminders than mobile phones; 91.5% versus 82.1% (p < 0.0001) at month 12 and 82.8% versus 75.4%, (p = 0.021) at month 18. Controlling for sex, age, education, occupation, community location, length of stay and marital status, the odds of good retention (completing 5 out of 6 follow-up visits) were 1.56 (95% CI;1.08-2.26, p = 0.018) for physical contact tracing compared to mobile phone tracing. Other statistically significant predictors of good retention were residing on islands and having stayed in the fishing communities for 5 or more years. Conclusions: Among fishing communities of Lake Victoria, Uganda, 84% of follow-up visits can be attained and participant retention is higher using physical contact reminders than mobile phones.

830,"The Ecological Role of the Vaquita, Phocoena sinus, in the Ecosystem of the Northern Gulf of California","From an ecosystem management perspective, analysis of the functional roles of species is a challenge. It is valuable to determine which species are irreplaceable within a given community based on their contribution to the system's organization. This study relates the emergent functional and structural indices of biological groups estimated from a trophic model of the Northern Gulf of California to identify the roles of these groups in the ecosystem context, with a particular focus on the role of the vaquita, an endemic porpoise in critically endangered status. The simulation of removing each group allowed the analysis of the removal's functional effect on the ecosystem's global attributes and organization (based on Ulanowicz's ascendency concept). Groups from lower trophic levels (TL) were more related to complexity indicators, suggesting their contribution to the organization and structure of energy flows in the food web. Groups from intermediate TL had higher values of structural indexes, indicating their function in the control of flows throughout the network. The vaquita along with other marine mammals, aquatic birds, and some species of fish with a high TL contribute in a similar way to the order (for example, ascendency/capacity-of-development ratio) of the system, showing a relatively high value of ascendency (contribution of the group to the organization inherent to the ecosystem) and the change in ecosystem ascendency when they were removed. The vaquita, like marine and coastal birds, plays a small role in the ecosystem. But like them, it does contribute substantially to ecosystem organization. This study thus provides information potentially useful for management in understanding the species' role and in reducing uncertainty in decision-making.

831,"Information diffusion in two marine protected area networks in the Central Visayas Region, Philippines","In order to strengthen biological and social success of community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Philippines, many organizations have begun instituting MPA networks. In the Central Visayas Region, Coastal Conservation and Education Foundation and Fisheries for Improved Sustainable Harvest are implementing socioecological networking initiatives. Educational programs, employing diverse methods such as cross visits and community MPA monitoring, are integral components of these projects. This article analyzes the relationship between education, information diffusion, and standard measures of MPA success (e.g., MPA rule compliance and fish abundance) in communities participating in these networks. Surveys were conducted with 13 individuals per community in 36 communities. Statistical tests reveal that the presence of a clear MPA leader, participation in cross visits, and presence of community environmental education programs were the strongest predictors of social and biological MPA success. Formal education programs (e.g., management committee member trainings) independent of other processes did not demonstrate strong statistical relationships with MPA success. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the current and potential benefits and efficacy of education programs for communities in MPA networks. When linked to a strong infrastructure for information diffusion, education programs have the potential to increase both biological and social MPA success.

832,Examining the Role of Social Capital in Community Collective Action for Sustainable Wetland Fisheries in Bangladesh,"Internationally, the decentralization of property rights is becoming an increasingly common policy intervention for sustainable natural resource management. In the context of decentralized wetland fisheries policy in Bangladesh, this paper examines the role that social capital plays in cooperation building and collective action among diverse households seeking to obtain fisheries property rights. It considers how some households are able to develop collective action in the form of a community-based organization to access wetland fisheries, and why other households are not. Using the Local Level Institution (LLI) study technique, our analysis highlights that the financial capacity of community members plays a crucial role in accessing resources when the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decentralization policy also seeks to generate State revenue through fees. In this situation, information access and communication with external agencies were found to be prerequisites for earning the wetland fisheries property rights, with local leaders able to take advantage of their position to dictate collective decision making. This situation resulted in undemocratic decentralization and devolution of wetland fisheries rights, undermining transparency, accountability and the equitable distribution of natural resources.

833,Linking small-scale fisheries co-management to U.N. Sustainable Development Goals,"Small-scale fisheries account for 90% of global fishers and 40% of the global catch. Effectively managing small-scale fisheries is, therefore, crucial to progressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Co-management and community-based fisheries management are widely considered the most appropriate forms of governance for many small-scale fisheries. We outlined relationships between small-scale fisheries co-management and attainment of the SDGs, including evidence for impacts and gaps in dominant logic. We identified 11 targets across five SDGs to which small-scale fisheries co-management (including community-based fisheries management) can contribute; the theory of change by which these contributions could be achieved; and the strength of evidence for progress toward SDG targets related to various co-management strategies. Our theory of change links the 11 SDG targets by qualifying that progress toward some targets is contingent on others being achieved first. We then reviewed 58 case studies of co-management impacts from the Pacific IslandsÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œa region rich in local marine governanceÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œto evaluate evidence of where, to what degree, and with how much certainty different co-management strategies conferred positive impacts to each SDG target. These strategies included access restrictions, permanent area closures, periodic closures, and gear and species restrictions. Although many studies provide evidence linking multiple co-management strategies to improvements in resource status (SDG 14.4), there was limited evidence of follow-on effects, such as improvements in catch (SDG 2.3, 2.4), livelihoods (SDG 1.2), consumption (SDG 2.1), and nutrition (SDG 2.2). Our findings suggest that leaps of logic and assumptions are prevalent in co-management planning and evaluation. Hence, when evaluating co-management impacts against the SDGs, consideration of ultimate goals is required, otherwise, there is a risk of shortfalls between aspirations and impact.

834,Applicability of ecological assessment tools for management decision-making: A case study from the Lima estuary (NW Portugal),"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to achieve and conserve a good ecological status of all surface waters, including estuarine environments, which should be assessed considering several biological elements, together with physical, chemical and pollution elements. In this study, we investigated the applicability of ecological indicators for a practical management issue: selection of the most suitable location for a marina in a salt-marsh temperate estuary (River Lima, NW Portugal). Considering the WFD principles, we assumed that the most suitable location for the implementation of a marina should be the one with the least ecological value, considering that it could be an opportunity for ecological rehabilitation. In order to attain this purpose, the ecological quality status of five potential locations in the navigable lower stretch of the Lima estuary was assessed following an ecosystem-based approach. Several key ecological quality elements such as physical and chemical parameters of water and sediment, phytoplankton biomass, as well as macroinvertebrate and fish communities were surveyed. In addition, heavy-metal analyses, fecal indicator evaluation and ""first-screening"" toxicity tests were also performed. All collected information was integrated using a scaled value approach, in order to rank the five locations. Furthermore, for the assessment of the ecological quality status of the potential sites, a macroinvertebrate (M-AMBI) and a demersal community based (EDI-Estuarine Demersal Indicators) indices were used. Different human pressures were detected, being the uppermost site more susceptible to urban wastewater discharge, whereas the location downstream the commercial seaport was more prone to accumulate contaminants in the sediments. The scaled values approach allowed the ranking of the potential sites, where the uppermost location ranked last. M-AMBI and EDI also classified that location with the lower ecological quality status. Both biological indices were in agreement concerning the discrimination of the location with the lowest ecological quality status, which coincided with the one ranked last by the scaled values approach. The selected biological indices proved to be useful tools for decision-making support in an environmental management context.

The Marine Extractive Reserves are the materialization of a community-based protected area model through a system of co-management where natural resources are managed pursuing its sustainable use. However, the model transferred to the coastal and marine environment finds conflicts of legal order, given the current Brazilian legislation. The conflict is due to the denial of access to resources in the areas demarcated as a reserve by citizens not designated as ""traditional population"". This access restriction does not find basis in Brazilian law, which can generate conflicts between beneficiaries and ""excluded."" Extractive Reserves are areas where the culture and values of traditional population should be preserved concurrently with the sustainable use of natural resources. But until today, there is no long-term studies that prove empirically whether the resources used are being managed in order to perpetuate themselves, considering their use by communities. Biological and anthropogenic factors must be constantly monitored in order to separate the fluctuations capture of natural order from the ones cause by human beings.

Ã¢â‚¬ËœCultural tourismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬Ëœethnic tourismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is there, but on the margins of nature-based tourism. Wildlife parks and beautiful landscapes are the main attractions here.

839,Incorporating indigenous rights and environmental justice into fishery management: Comparing policy challenges and potentials from Alaska and Hawaii,"Colonial processes including the dispossession of indigenous lands and resources and the development of Western management institutions to govern the use of culturally important fish resources have served in many ways to marginalize indigenous interests within the United States fisheries. In recent years, several US fishery institutions have begun to develop policies that can confront this colonial legacy by better accommodating indigenous perspectives and rights in fishery management practices. This paper analyzes two such policies: the 2005 community quota entity program in Alaska which permits rural communities (predominantly Alaska Native villages) to purchase and lease commercial halibut fishing privileges and the 1994 State of Hawaii community-based subsistence fishing area (CBSFA) legislation through which Native Hawaiian communities can designate marine space near their community as CBSFAs and collaborate with the state of Hawaii to manage those areas according to traditional Hawaiian practices. The analysis reveals a striking similarity between the trajectories of these two policies. While they both offered significant potential for incorporating indigenous rights and environmental justice into state or federal fishery management, they have so far largely failed to do so. Environmental managers can gain insights from the challenges and potentials of these two policies. In order to introduce meaningful change, environmental policies that incorporate indigenous rights and environmental justice require a commitment of financial and institutional support from natural resource agencies, a commitment from indigenous groups and communities to organize and develop capacity, and careful consideration of contextual and cultural factors in the design of the policy framework.

840,"Population recovery, seasonal site fidelity, and daily activity of pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) in an Amazonian floodplain mosaic","Pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) are the world's largest scaled freshwater fish, reaching 3Ã‚Â m in length and >200Ã‚Â kg in weight. Historical overfishing has devastated populations of this remarkable fish across Amazonian floodplains, but community-based management programmes are now stimulating the recovery of wild populations. Pirarucu have evolved a unique set of life history traits, some of which have important implications for population management. Individuals exhibit lateral annual migration patterns during the prolonged annual flood pulse, entering flooded forests to reproduce and forage. During this period, although managed fish stocks become less monopolisable by local communities responsible for managing protected lakes, pirarucu can occupy and reproduce in new environments and thus potentially contribute to population recovery. Here, we show a strong pattern of pirarucu (Arapaima cf. gigas) population recovery under community-based management in an area along the JuruÃƒÂ¡ River, in western Brazilian Amazonia. We show evidence of population recovery even outside formal protected areas, reinforcing the suitability of pirarucu community-based management as a powerful tool for both biodiversity conservation and the improvement of local livelihoods. We also show pirarucu movements across a floodplain mosaicÃ¢â‚¬â€including lakes, the main river channel, tributary streams, and flooded forestsÃ¢â‚¬â€during the wet season. Our results support evidence of site fidelity among migrating pirarucu, justifying the high effort invested by local communities in seasonally protecting lakes from poachers and illegal fishers. Finally, restricted daily movement patterns by pirarucu support the suitability of population estimates based on day-time counts because the chance of double counting is substantially reduced during the day when these counts are conducted. We highlight the strong suitability of this species for community-based management, since they can: (1) replenish new environments during the wet season through migration and possibly also reproduction; and (2) be efficiently harvested during the dry season, delivering social and ecological benefits at large spatial scales. Positive examples of fisheries management, which align biodiversity conservation and social development, are important for building optimism, and influencing local and international stakeholders. Our study shows how engaging and empowering local communities to help monitor the movement ecology of target species can be an effective strategy to support the sustainable management of aquatic resources in tropical environments.

843,Lessons from community based management of floodplain fisheries in Bangladesh,"Inland (floodplain) fisheries remain the most important contributor to fish production in Bangladesh. They have in the past been administered to generate government revenue without due concern for sustainability or equity. Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) is a possible solution and was tested in 19 waterbodies (rivers and beels) during 1996-2000. The outcomes so far are assessed with respect to social, institutional, and physical context, and the interactions that arose in establishing CBFM. The lessons drawn are that: it was essential that communities obtained rights over the fisheries, strong facilitation was necessary, taking up visible resource management actions greatly helped, success was more likely in homogeneous communities, external threats were a strong limiting factor, clear boundaries and small fisheries were not so critical, and new institutions could be built with as much ease (or difficulty) as modifying existing ones. Effective well-defined partnerships of NGOs and government were not easy to establish but were sufficiently beneficial that in several locations new community institutions for fisheries management were established. This is a slow process, the sustainability of local management institutions is not yet established, although they continued during an interim period without funding, further phased support is planned to strengthen these organizations and to generate evidence of impacts and momentum to influence wider fisheries policy in and beyond Bangladesh.

844,Testing a model to assess womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inclusion and participation in community-based resource management in Solomon Islands,"Community-based fisheries management (CBFM) is a standard management framework in Melanesia. Yet, there is increasing evidence that women, among other marginalised groups, experience barriers to inclusion in decision-making processes. Through a case study in three communities in Marovo Lagoon, Solomon Islands, we adapted AgarwalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2001 participation typology for a Melanesian CBFM context to present a participation model for assessing gender inclusivity in CBFM. We defined six levels of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participation, including, (1) no participation, (2) nominal, (3) passive, (4) consultive, (5) active, and (6) interactive (empowering) participation, defined as actively participating in all aspects of the decision-making process, and holding leadership roles that increase womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence and power across the community. The model should be broadly useful throughout Melanesia across many different cultural contexts, though we anticipate that aspects will need adaptation in different contexts, both within and beyond Solomon Islands. We found that the three study communities respectively fell within the passive, consultive, and active levels. Our results show that gender parity, that is equal representation of women and men, is not a reliable indicator of gender equity. The utility of the model lies in its implementation, which requires engagement with gender power structures. This work contributes to the gender, small-scale fisheries, and community-based management literature by assessing womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participation in CBFM decision-making processes through use of a participation model, and providing recommendations to fisheries practitioners on implementation of the model to assess gender equity in a communityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CBFM structures.

845,Building NigeriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response to climate change: Pilot projects for community-based adaptation in Nigeria,"Throughout history, human societies have had to effectively devise ways and means to adapt to climate variability by altering their lifestyles, agriculture, settlements and other critical aspects of their economies and livelihoods. The capacity to adapt enables societies to deal with a range of uncertainties. Coping and adaptation is a way of life in Nigeria, where climate variability is the norm and where planting cycles in a largely rain-fed agricultural system are affected by reoccurring droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. Climate change scenarios for Nigeria suggest a warmer climate and projected changes in precipitation suggest it will be wetter in the south along the coast and drier in the northeast. The climate models also suggest more extreme heat events will occur. Resource dependent people, such as farmers, hunters and fishers, who depend directly on the productivity of natural resources around them for their livelihoods, are the first to be impacted by these changes in local environmental conditions. The Government of Nigeria is a signatory to the UNFCCC and there is an initiative underway to develop a national strategy for community-based climate change adaptation. Since 2007, the Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST) is an NGO has been implementing the project Building NigeriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Response to Climate Change (BNRCC). Pilot Projects are one component of BNRCC, and are designed to test adaptation options on a small scale in order to strengthen the resilience of communities to climate change, increase their adaptive capacity and provide recommendations based on lessons learned from community-based adaptation projects to the national strategy. The projects involve seven partner organizations who are working directly with 15 vulnerable communities spanning Nigeria from the Sahel in the north east to the Coastal/Rainforest in the south east. The projects include but are not restricted to: increasing food security by introducing improved crop varieties; testing alternative livelihood options such as aquaculture in order to provide a means of income and decrease reliance on dwindling forest resources; providing fuel efficient wood stoves; improving access to water sources to deal with water scarcity; and tree planting for ecosystem rehabilitation.

847,Adaptive Capacity Level Shapes Social Vulnerability to Climate Change of Fishing Communities in the South Brazil Bight,"Understanding the social vulnerabilities and community strategies to adapt to environmental changes are crucial for the development of actions to enhance both community conservation and survival. With the aim to identify the drivers of vulnerability to climate change among different coastal communities a comprehensive multi-scale vulnerability framework was here adopted. Eight selected fishing communities representative of the South Brazil Bight (SBB) area were surveyed at the household level. A total of 151 fishers were interviewed. Quantitative indicators were calculated at the community-level, and their drivers identified, allowing for comparisons of the overall vulnerability score. Findings revealed that remoteness and the lack of climate change-related institutional support increase vulnerability among fishing communities in the region. On the other hand, community organization, leadership, research partnerships, community-based co-management, and livelihood diversification reduce vulnerability. Our analysis focused on social vulnerability to climate change in regional fishing communities and provides a better understanding of these effects in coastal zones, the factors explaining vulnerability and some perspectives on resilient and adaptable systems. Learning from comparisons at the ecosystem level may be applied to coastal regions elsewhere.

848,"A community-based approach to disseminate health information on the hazards of prenatal mercury exposure in Brooklyn, NY","Exposure to mercury (Hg) in utero can have neurotoxic effects on the developing fetus. Mercury exposure in women of childbearing age has been associated with frequent fish consumption, coastal proximity, foreign birth, and exposure during ritualistic practices. The aim of this study was to identify culturally-appropriate strategies to disseminate messages on the hazards of in utero Hg exposure in fertile and pregnant women in a predominantly urban immigrant community in Flatbush, Brooklyn, following findings from a recent study on mercury exposure in this community. Nineteen key informant interviews were conducted in Flatbush, Brooklyn with community members, medical professionals, fishmongers, and a religious practitioner to solicit feedback on culturally sensitive methods to educate the community on Hg hazards. The main themes identified include clinical integration, where providers integrate the message in routine care; community integration, whereby influential organizations and community members foster message delivery; media usage; and message reinforcement via continuous exposure. It is vital for healthcare providers and public health practitioners to be culturally sensitive in educating their patients on fish selection during pregnancy and safety of handling Hg. Instead of a single approach, a combination of media and educational strategies would help to reinforce the message. These findings form a basis for public health campaigns to apprise other urban immigrant communities of the hazards of in utero Hg exposure.

849,Moving toward spatial solutions in marine conservation with indigenous communities,"Community and resource user support has often been declared as essential to achieving globally agreed targets for marine protection. Given that indigenous people in Canada have resource use rights, we engaged two indigenous communities in British Columbia for their views on marine planning and protected areas. We developed a three-phased approach for executing our research: building research partnerships, carrying out individual interviews, and holding community discussion sessions. Participants expressed a common goal of recovering depleted species and ensuring the sustainability of indigenous fishing. We found strong support for spatial protection measures, and significant overlaps amongst participants in the areas suggested for protection. The most common type of protection recommended by participants was the exclusion of commercial and recreational fisheries while allowing for indigenous fishing; this stands in contrast to the emphasis on strict no-take MPAs advocated in the literature. Similarities in the goal, and level and areas of protection point to a gap in conservation approaches: the conservation of important areas and resources to indigenous people, allowing the continued practice and adaptation of their culture.

851,Measuring behavioral social learning in a conservation context: Chilean fishing communities,"In the sustainability and conservation sciences, Ã¢â‚¬Å“social learningÃ¢â‚¬Â is defined as a group process which depends on trust and social capital and tends to boost conservation outcomes. We term this Ã¢â‚¬Å“collaborative social learning.Ã¢â‚¬Â Meanwhile, the behavioral sciences define social learning as the individual use of socially acquired information and seek to explain how individuals employ social learning as part of adaptive behavior. We term this Ã¢â‚¬Å“behavioral social learning.Ã¢â‚¬Â However, the influence of behavioral social learning on ecological outcomes is poorly understood. We conducted a study of behavioral social learning among fishers in seven communities in Chile's Region V to probe its connections with ecological outcomes and collaborative social learning. We develop and employ a novel behavioral measure of individual social learning in a simple fishing game in which fishers may pay a portion of their game earnings to observe and learn from other fishers in the game. We explore the internal and external validity of the instrument. The self-consistency of game play, learning, and participant reflections reveals strong internal validity of the learning game. Additionally, game behavior is correlated with factors such as migration history, and the perceived availability of peers from whom to learn, suggesting the method also holds external validity. We then test whether factors associated with collaborative social learning, such as social capital, are related to social learning behavior as measured by the experiment. Interestingly, many correlates of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcollaborative social learningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are not strongly correlated with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbehavioral social learningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in our sample. We argue that this disconnect can help improve our understanding of the emergence of community-based conservation and positive ecological outcomes as well as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcollaborative social learningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ itself. Finally, we provide guidance on how behavioral measures of social learning could benefit community-based natural resource management and conservation. Ã‚Â© 2021 The Authors.

853,Alternatives to conventional management: Lessons from small-scale fisheries,"Based on long-term research on community-based resource management, and using small-scale fisheries as an example, alternatives to conventional management may be characterized by: a shift in philosophy to embrace uncertainty and complexity; an appreciation of fisheries as social-ecological systems and more broadly as complex adaptive systems; an expansion of scope of management information to include fishers' knowledge; formulation of management objectives that incorporate livelihood issues; and development of participatory management with community-based institutions and cross-scale governance. Such alternative management is adaptive as well as participatory in nature, as it engages the knowledge of resource users, their adaptive learning, and their institutions for self-governance. It is human-oriented but uses an ecosystem approach, effectively linking social systems with natural systems. Such management breaks out of the old tradition of management-as-control. It effectively redefines resource to mean, not commodity, but elements of an ecosystem that supports essential processes as well as human needs. It also redefines management to refer to governance, learning and adaptive management, oriented to maintaining the productive capacity and resilience of the linked social-ecological system.",NA,No,The paper does not specify a case study from any of the listed countries in the title or abstract.," No; The abstract and title do not mention any specific case study from the listed countries.

854,"Sustaining Rocky Mountain landscapes: Science, policy, and management for the crown of the continent ecosystem","Prato and Fagre offer the first systematic, multi-disciplinary assessment of the challenges involved in managing the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem (CCE), an area of the Rocky Mountains that includes northwestern Montana, southwestern Alberta, and southeastern British Columbia. The spectacular landscapes, extensive recreational options, and broad employment opportunities of the CCE have made it one of the fastest growing regions in the United States and Canada, and have lead to a shift in its economic base from extractive resources to service-oriented recreation and tourism industries. In the process, however, the amenities and attributes that draw people to this 'New West' are under threat. Pastoral scenes are disappearing as agricultural lands and other open spaces are converted to residential uses, biodiversity is endangered by the fragmentation of fish and wildlife habitats, and many areas are experiencing a decline in air and water quality. Sustaining Rocky Mountain Landscapes provides a scientific basis for communities to develop policies for managing the growth and economic transformation of the CCE without sacrificing the quality of life and environment for which the land is renowned. The book begins with a natural and economic history of the CCE. It follows with an assessment of current physical and biological conditions in the CCE. The contributors then explore how social, economic, demographic, and environmental forces are transforming ecosystem structure and function. They consider ecosystem change in response to changing patterns of land use, pollution, and drought; the increasing risk of wildfire to wildlife and to human life and property; and the implications of global climate change on the CCE.

855,"The SOS pesca project: A multinational and intersectoral collaboration for sustainable fisheries, Marine conservation and improved quality of life in coastal communities","Healthy fisheries, particularly small-scale fisheries, are closely linked to prosperous and healthy coastal communities and resilient marine environments. CubaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marine and coastal ecosystems are highly biodiverse and support fisheries vital to food security and the national economy. Cuban government and state institutions, scientists, managers and fishersÃ¢â‚¬â€along with colleagues from other countriesÃ¢â‚¬â€have expressed growing concern about the decline of fishing resources. In 2012, under the aegis of the National Center for Protected Areas, Cuban institutions from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment and the Ministry of Foreign Investment partnered with the Italian nongovernmental organization, COSPE Onlus, to launch SOS Pesca, a four-year project to achieve sustainable fisheries management, conserve marine habitats and improve quality of life in two Cuban fishing communities (Guayabal in Las Tunas Province and Playa Florida in CamagÃƒÂ¼ey Province). SOS Pesca involved the municipal governments of Amancio RodrÃƒÂ­guez (in Las Tunas Province) and Florida (in CamagÃƒÂ¼ey Province), delegates to the Municipal Assembly of PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Power (municipal government) from Guayabal (Amancio RodrÃƒÂ­guez Municipality) and Playa Florida (Florida Municipality), the state-owned fishing industry, private fishers, local families, protected area officials and staff scientists, municipal governments and international nongovernmental organizations. By the end of 2012, a new USÃ¢â‚¬â€œCuban collaboration emerged when COSPE recruited Environmental Defense Fund to provide scientific and technical support, trainings and exchanges focused on fisheries. SOS Pesca succeeded at community, regional fishing zone and national levels. Outcomes included: an assessment of finfish identifying species most vulnerable to fishing (methods and capacities), a proposed management plan for finfish, a National Plan of Action for sharks and rays, two marine protected areas established, increased employment through socioeconomic alternatives, revitalization of community environmental brigades, and greater capacity to use fishery assessment methods and develop management strategies. Perhaps the greatest achievement was communitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ changed perceptions of their marine environment, the need for conservation and sustainable resource management, and their active role in this objective. SOS Pesca spurred a more participatory form of integrated marine and coastal management in CubaÃ¢â‚¬â€one that integrates fisheries and spatial management, links fishing families and coastal communities with scientists and administrators to find solutions that support sustainability, and connects economic alternatives to community-based conservation and improved food security.

856,Climate change and food security in india: Adaptation strategies and major challenges,"India has made rapid strides in improving food production and the country has become not only self-sufficient in food production, but now exports to several other countries as well. However, climate change has emerged as a major threat to India's hard-earned success. Much of India's population depends on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing, and thus the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people are at risk. In fact, the country has already witnessed adverse impacts of climate change on food production, transportation, storage, and distribution. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, extreme weather conditions (such as prolonged droughts and floods), changing soil fertility, and new pest infestations are major factors contributing to stagnant agricultural growth. ""Climate-smart agriculture"" is considered a pragmatic approach to ensuring food security in a changing climate. Adaptation strategies based on the principles of climate-smart agriculture can counter the impacts of climate change, such as the promotion of conservation agriculture, the sustainable management of natural resources and the promotion of climate-smart crops. However, the existing problems of transboundary water conflict, universal insurance of crops, the significant reduction in food wastage needed and the improvement of food distribution are essential to achieving the goals for adaptation. It is also important to note that ready acceptance of ""climate-smart agriculture"" by farmers cannot be expected, even if the necessary technologies are made accessible to them. Rather, more community-based participatory research is needed to explore socioeconomic and location-specific variables that are influencing farmers' preferences towards the approach.

857,"Factors influencing success of marine protected areas in the Visayas, Philippines as related to increasing protected area coverage","Throughout the world there is a general consensus among environmentalists that there should be an increase in the amount of marine area that should be reserved in marine protected areas (MPAs). In fact, the 1998 Philippines Fishery Code indicates a need for designation of at least 15% of municipal waters for fish refuges or sanctuaries.

858,Trade-offs in values assigned to ecological goods and services associated with different coral reef management strategies,"Societies value ecosystems and the services they provide in a number of ways. These values can help inform the management of ecosystems such as coral reefs. However, the trade-offs in ecosystem goods and services associated with different social and management conditions are poorly understood. Consequently, we examined values assigned to the goods and services identified across three types of management on the Kenyan coast: (1) a government-imposed no-take area in the Mombasa Marine National Park; (2) co-management of gear between fishing communities and the government's fisheries department; and (3) community-initiated no-take area management, where a community independently initiated and controlled a small closed area. We compared the ecosystem goods and services and the broader total economic value to explore how the history of these sites, their social conditions, and different management choices were associated with these values. The highest total economic values were associated with government management interventions and were probably due to the government's priority to be involved in the high-value beach tourism destinations. This is, however, associated with losses in a range of local community-level values and the social capital of the resource-user community. For example, resource users near the government marine protected area had the lowest value for measures of biological knowledge. Sites displaying greater community-level values were characterized by high social capital, and users had the most confidence in their ability to manage the resource. This study suggests that trade-offs occur in values associated with the interests and responsibilities of the management. The ability to cope with disturbance and change will depend on these values and responsibilities, and local communities are less likely to respond when government management and interests are strong.

Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) has the potential to provide valuable insights on large (spatial and temporal) scales, by drawing on the collective experiences of those who work closely with the taxa of interest. This study explored the status of shark population over time in four countries across eastern and southern Arabia (i.e. Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Yemen). Results indicate strong declines, with highly experienced fishermen reporting greater perceived declines (80%) in the abundance of sharks (in general), with mean year of perceived decline starting in the late 1990s to early 2000s. For three specific taxa investigated, hammerhead sharks (e.g. Sphyrna mokarran) had the greatest mean perceived decline (80%), while even the group with the least decline (small carcharhinids) had mean perceived declines of 50%. Management measures are urgently required in the region to ensure sustainability of historic shark fisheries that provide food security and coastal livelihoods (e.g. Yemen and Oman), and to prevent regional extinctions (e.g. hammerhead sharks).

860,"Community-based stock enhancement and fisheries management of the Japanese Flounder in Fukushima, Japan","In Fukushima Prefecture, one million hatchery-reared juvenile Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus have been released annually in the stock enhancement program since 1996. A community-based management system is used for this flounder fishery, where fishers pay 5% of their annual landings to operate the stock enhancement program. Also, since 1993, fishers have consented not to catch flounder 30 cm total length to maximize economic gains from the investment in stock enhancement. Our fish market surveys revealed that released flounder annually contributed an additional 30-90 tons to the catch. However, the economic efficiency of stocking has reduced since 1996, which has been largely attributed to a decline in fish price and recapture rate. Another problem is that the population dynamics of wild flounder have never been considered during implementation of the stock enhancement program. The occurrence of a dominant year-class of wild flounder causes a dramatic increase in landings and removes the need to release hatchery-reared juveniles. However, the program cannot be easily terminated because it plays important roles in having fishers recognize the importance of fishery management. It is a difficult but important realistic problem concerning how to make the stock enhancement program more flexible and effective.

Despite their importance, most of the world's estimated 10,000 SSFs are data deficient. Community data is critical to understanding fish stocks, and evaluating fisheries management policies, particularly in remote areas. This pilot study explores the potential for smartphones and the Open Data Kit software to assist in the collection of shark landings data in southwest Madagascar, where sustainable fisheries management is critical to economic and food security. The pilot builds on a previous study of participatory data collection using paper notebooks (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2016), which continued in eight villages throughout the smartphone trial (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2016), allowing comparisons in speed, accuracy and user experience to be drawn. Initial challenges, which included limited electricity supplies to charge the smartphones; typing errors caused by wet hands; and interpretation difficulties, were overcome during the trial with additional training and data accuracy improved as a result, with only 5% fewer records recorded on phones vs. paper notebooks by 2015. One major challenge - limited mobile network coverage Ã¢â‚¬â€œ often prevented data from being uploaded from phones to an online database, meaning manual data extraction was required, with associated travel costs. With appropriate training, smartphones show promise as a useful and accurate tool for participatory fisheries data collection. However, this method may be better suited to regions with stronger mobile coverage.

866,"Effects of community-based management on amazon river turtles: A case study of podocnemis sextuberculata in the Lower Amazon Floodplain, ParÃƒÂ¡, Brazil","Podocnemis sextuberculata is cited as ""vulnerable"" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List due to a decline in its population as a result of the intensive exploitation pressure throughout its range. Understanding the effects of environmental characteristics and human activities on turtle populations is essential to improve current conservation programs. We analyzed the abundance of Podocnemis sextuberculata in the lower Amazon, where a management experiment is under way, by comparing neighboring areas with and without community-based management (CBM) initiatives. In addition, we analyzed the influence of environmental variables on the species' abundance. Abundance was measured by captures per unit effort expressed in number of individuals (CPUEN) and biomass (CPUEB). The effects of CBM and environmental variables were tested by General Linear Model analysis. A total of 354 individuals were captured, 321 in the areas under CBM and 33 in areas without CBM. CPUEN and CPUEB were strongly correlated, and their values were about 10-fold higher in the areas carrying out CBM initiatives. The variable that best explained variation in CPUEN and CPUEB was CBM. Distance between the sampling point and the nearest nesting beach and river level also influenced capture rates. Results clearly show that local fishing restrictions can have a positive influence on turtle populations.

867,Evaluating community fishery management using Fishers' perceptions in the Tonle Sap lake of Cambodia,"There is an emerging consensus among academics and resource managers that successful resource management systems must be developed locally and account for a diverse range of political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors. In this research we evaluate and categorize the fishers' perspectives on the environmental, economic, social, and legal impacts of transitioning from a private property system to community fisheries in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake. Specifically, this paper uses interview results (N = 523) to assess the perceptions of local communities following a reform in 2012, whereby a commercial leasehold system was replaced with a community-based fishery management system. Results demonstrate that this conversion of fishery management systems is perceived as helping to improve economic, environmental, and legal conditions at the macro-level, but improvements in economic productivity at the individual level are inconclusive. This paper reveals the inherent complexity, benefits, and trade-offs involved in community-based management by exploring fishers' perceptions. One implication of this study is that the data reinforce the importance of participatory engagement in the development of resource management systems.

868,Tobacco screening multicomponent quality improvement network program: Beyond education,"Objectives: Due to the addictive nature of the disease and interrelated societal influences on the behavior of tobacco use, repeated interventions are often required before people successfully stop using tobacco. Our objective was to implement a multicomponent clinical intervention initiative enabling health care providers to effectively screen for tobacco use. We also sought to describe changes in emergency medicine providers' documentation of cessation advice to tobacco users. Methods: The intervention was conducted at three emergency departments (EDs) and four clinics at a community-based teaching hospital and health network. Health care providers with the opportunity to identify and counsel tobacco-using patients in ambulatory health care settings were the study population. The authors initiated a quality improvement initiative for tobacco screening that employed a multicomponent strategy to facilitate systemic changes that support 100% tobacco use identification, documentation, and counseling. Baseline, posteducation, and post-wrap-around documented screening rates were compared within each site across the intervention. Cumulative ED baseline, posteducation, and post-wrap-around rates of provider advice to tobacco users were compared across the intervention. Percentage of possible available gain was calculated in consideration of a 100% ceiling effect. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MetStat. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's chi-square cell frequency were used to analyze and compare sites. Fisher's exact test was used to compare those tests with a chi-square cell frequency of five or less. The statistical tests used for pre-/postintervention percentage comparisons by site had power between 80% and 90%, detecting differences of 10% and 20% or more at a 0.05 level of significance. Results: Significant increases in posteducation screening rates for all ED sites complemented significant increases in ED post-wrap-around intervention screening rates. Significant increases in ED provider documented cessation advice were also noted. Conclusions: This initiative successfully changed tobacco screening behavior of health care providers at all sites. It was particularly successful in the ED, typically an environment less likely to be conducive to preventive health interventions.

869,Toward integrated opisthorchiasis control in northeast Thailand: The Lawa project,"Human liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, a food-borne trematode is a significant public health problem in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand. Despite a long history of control programmes in Thailand and a nationwide reduction, O. viverrini infection prevalence remains high in the northeastern provinces. Therefore, a new strategy for controlling the liver fluke infection using the EcoHealth/One Health approach was introduced into the Lawa Lake area in Khon Kaen province where the liver fluke is endemic. A programme has been carried using anthelminthic treatment, novel intensive health education methods both in the communities and in schools, ecosystem monitoring and active community participation. As a result, the infection rate in the more than 10 villages surrounding the lake has declined to approximate one third of the average of 50% as estimated by a baseline survey. Strikingly, the Cyprinoid fish species in the lake, which are the intermediate host, now showed less than 1% prevalence compared to a maximum of 70% at baseline. This liver fluke control programme, named ""Lawa model,"" is now recognised nationally and internationally, and being expanding to other parts of Thailand and neighbouring Mekong countries.

870,Integrated coastal management in the Philippines: Testing new paradigms,"With fisheries declining, coral reefs battered, mangrove forests under threat, pollution levels rising, and coastal communities experiencing increased poverty, the Philippines faces severe challenges in managing its coastal resources. Coastal management efforts began in the Philippines more than 20 years ago through various community-based projects. Now, integrated coastal management is expanding in the country and holds the potential to reverse the trends. This article analyzes the situation in relation to new approaches for coastal management being undertaken through the Coastal Resource Management Project supported by the United States Agency for International Development implemented by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. This project, drawing on the lessons generated by past and ongoing coastal management initiatives, is emphasizing integrated approaches to management over narrowly focused fisheries management and habitat protection efforts. It highlights the increasingly important role of local governments and the changing roles of national government to effectively support integrated coastal management. Multisectoral collaboration is explained as standard procedure to achieve outcomes that are broad based and sustainable. Local and national level activities are contrasted and shown as essential complements in building institutionalization of resources management within all levels of government. A practical result framework is explained for measuring relative success at the local government level of implementing best practices for coastal management. Finally, lessons being learned related to collaboration, level of focus, education, and communication; who is responsible; and expansion of the project are highlighted.",NA,No,"The paper is focused on the Philippines, not any of the countries listed in the SC."," No; The paper is clearly about coastal management in the Philippines, not any of the countries listed in the SC.

871,Ancient fish weir technology for modern stewardship: lessons from community-based salmon monitoring,"Introduction: The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that indigenous people have a fundamental right to contribute to the management of the resources that support their livelihoods. Salmon are vital to the economy and culture of First Nations in coastal British Columbia, Canada. In this region, traditional systems of management including weirsÃ¢â‚¬â€œfences built across rivers to selectively harvest salmonÃ¢â‚¬â€œsupported sustainable fisheries for millennia. In the late-19th century traditional fishing practices were banned as colonial governments consolidated control over salmon. Outcomes: In collaboration with the Heiltsuk First Nation we revived the practice of weir building in the Koeye River. Over the first four years of the project we tagged 1,226 sockeye, and counted 8,036 fish during fall stream walks. We used a mark-recapture model which accounted for both pre-spawn mortality due to variation in temperature, and tag loss, to produce the first mark-resight estimates of sockeye abundance in the watershed (4,600Ã¢â‚¬â€œ15,000 escapement). Discussion: High river temperatures are associated with increased en route morality in migrating adult sockeye. We estimated pre-spawn mortality ranged from 8Ã¢â‚¬â€œ72% across the four years of study, highlighting the degree to which climate conditions may dictate future viability in sockeye salmon populations. These results demonstrate the power of fusing traditional knowledge and management systems with contemporary scientific approaches in developing local monitoring. Ã‚Â© 2017, Ã‚Â© 2017 The Author(s).

872,Techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of fish habitat restoration works in streams impacted by logging activities,"The Watershed Restoration Program (WRP) in British Columbia was initiated under the auspices of Forest Renewal B.C. to restore, protect and maintain fisheries, aquatic and forest resources adversely impacted by past forest-harvesting practices, by carrying out community-based remedial work on hillslopes and streams. Specific restoration components focus on impacted hillslopes, gullies, riparian areas, stream channels and fish habitat. Fish habitat restoration is typically carried out after an assessment of upslope risks (followed by rehabilitation) and instream conditions. Restoration techniques include restoring fish access, streambank stabilization, rehabilitating channelled reaches to provide fish holding pools and riffles, re-establishing instream cover and structure by addition of boulder clusters and large woody debris (LWD), restoring and creating off-channel habitat, and resupply of nutrients. After the restoration work is completed, research evaluation and operational monitoring are conducted to determine the overall success and ultimate benefit of the work. Research evaluation is not project-specific, but may involve evaluation of a specific technique (e.g., LWD placements), and synoptic studies and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢paired assessmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of experimental control and treatment streams. Routine and project effectiveness monitoring is project-specific and is carried out after the instream work is completed and has passed post-construction inspection. Routine monitoring is a low intensity activity to determine functionality and condition of the restoration works. It is mainly a visual activity, and may include simple measurements or indicators (e.g., for structural stability), and can be undertaken on an annual basis or after each major storm. Project effectiveness monitoring is of higher intensity, and is conducted on a selected sub-set of projects where there are uncertainties of outcome or adaptive management benefits. This monitoring typically includes fish sampling and physical measurements: pool widths and depths, stream gradient, channel form, and channel substrate characteristics. Engineering level surveys (to tie bed and water surface elevations and cross sections to a specific benchmark) are frequently required for quantitative comparisons of restoration works (before, as-constructed and post-restoration). Where possible, project effectiveness monitoring should be related to published estimates of increases in fish abundance due to habitat improvements (bio-standards) established during the planning and prescriptive phase. Evaluation and monitoring of fish habitat restoration projects, both in the shorter and longer term, are essential to improve biological, technical and cost effectiveness of projects, and to identify and incorporate innovations. Evaluation techniques described in the paper were developed to evaluate activities to restore streams impacted by past logging practices, but the underlying principles apply to stream restoration wherever forest, urban or agriculture practices have resulted in stream and riparian impairment.

873,What is a green economy? Review of national-level green economy policies in cambodia and Lao PDR,"A green economy that simultaneously promotes environmental sustainability, social inclusiveness, and economic growth is expected to benefit the heavily resource-dependent least developed countries. Yet, internationally, there is very little empirically based research on how the ""green development"" agenda translates into natural resource management policies in the least developed countries. This paper examines the implementation of green economy policies at the national level in the energy and forestry sectors in the Lao PDR and Cambodia. Both countries have adopted green growth targets; however, in terms of natural resources management, two contradictory processes have taken place during the past decade. While there have been some initiatives to decentralize natural resource management by enhancing the role of local communities role, such as community-based forest or fishery management, the far greater trend has been the opening up of the economies of the Lao PDR and Cambodia to large-scale investments by multinational enterprises. Large-scale hydropower projects and increasing deforestation pose challenges to more sustainable natural resource management efforts. This article is based on an analysis of the national green economy strategies and expert interviews with the government, academia, private sector and international and national development organizations. Focusing on the energy and forestry sectors, but also analysing the national green economy strategies as a whole, our analysis sheds light on the choices made in the national development versus green economy strategies. While green economy thinking rests on strong state regulation, the policies are often formulated within a complex dynamic of donor and investor interests. The achievement of a green economy depends on the state; thus, it should steer investments to ecologically less harmful industries and ensure social inclusiveness in land-use decisions. Our results show, however, that implementing a green economy is far more complex. Despite the quest for synergies, at the sectoral level there are still many unaddressed trade-offs between, for example, energy sources and forms of land use.

874,"Fishing and trade of devil rays (Mobula spp.) in the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh: Insights from fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ knowledge","Devil rays (Mobula spp.) are globally threatened cartilaginous fishes that have attracted global conservation concern owing to their high extinction risk and lack of protection in many countries. Limited resources and data on threatened marine species, including devil rays, impede conservation actions, particularly in developing countries, many of which have high biodiversity. Devil ray catch is a component of artisanal fisheries in Bangladesh, but data on their fisheries and trade are limited. To characterize devil ray fishing practices, fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perception and trade, 230 fishers and traders were interviewed between 4 June 2018 and 22 June 2019, in four areas of south-east Bangladesh. Catch data were also opportunistically collected at landing sites. Six devil ray species were documented, caught in an array of gill nets, set-bag nets and longlines. All interviewed fishers reported life-long devil ray bycatch in some numbers, and also noted a decline in catch over the last decade. Bottom trawling, increased bycatch levels, increased demand for devil ray products and, in some cases, ecosystem changes were identified by fishers as threats to devil ray populations. Unregulated and undocumented trade and retained bycatch, especially by gill nets and set-bag nets, are fuelled by local consumption of devil ray meat and international trade in meat and gill rakers. Compliance with international trade control treaties for all Mobula spp. or the Bangladeshi law protecting Mobula mobular was low, with the majority of fishers (87%, n = 174) unaware of their existence. To manage devil ray fisheries, and prevent possible population declines, we propose a combination of legally enforced gear modifications, and catch and trade control through community-owned implementation strategies. Additionally, we propose the simultaneous implementation of inclusive, community-based awareness and stewardship projects in conjunction with a coast-wide ray monitoring programme. Finally, we emphasize that more research and action rooted in a sustainable fishery model is urgently needed to protect Bangladeshi devil ray populations.

875,"Two steps forward, two steps back: The role of innovation in transforming towards community-based marine resource management in Solomon Islands","In many coastal nations, community-based arrangements for marine resource management (CBRM) are promoted by government, advocated for by non-government actors, and are seen by both as one of the most promising options to achieve sustainable use and secure inshore fisheries and aquatic resources. Although there is an abundant literature on what makes CBRM effective, is it less clear how CBRM is introduced or develops as an idea in a community, and the process of how the idea leads to the adoption of a new resource management approach with supporting institutions. Here we aim to address this gap by applying an explicit process-based approach drawing on innovation history methodology by mapping and analysing the initiation and emergence of CBRM in five fishing-dependent communities in Solomon Islands. We use insights from the literatures on diffusion of innovation and transformability to define phases of the process and help guide the inductive analysis of qualitative data. We show the CBRM institutionalisation processes were non-linear, required specific strategies to move from one phase to the next, and key elements facilitated or hindered movement. Building active support for CBRM within communities depended on the types of events that happened at the beginning of the process and actions taken to sustain this. Matching CBRM to known resource management ideas or other social problems in the community, developing legitimate institutions and decision-making processes, strong continual interactions between key actors and the rest of the community (not necessarily NGO actors), and community members witnessing benefits of CBRM, all contributed to the emergence and diffusion of CBRM in the communities, and helped to overcome barriers to transformative change.

877,Cockles in custody: The role of common property arrangements in the ecological sustainability of mangrove fisheries on the Ecuadorian coast,"Scholars of common property resource theory (CPR) have long asserted that certain kinds of institutional arrangements based on collective action result in successful environmental stewardship, but feedback and the direct link between social and ecological systems remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how common property institutional arrangements contribute to sustainable mangrove fisheries in coastal Ecuador, focusing on the fishery for the mangrove cockle (Anadara tuberculosa and A. similis), a bivalve mollusk harvested from the roots of mangrove trees and of particular social, economic, and cultural importance for the communities that depend on it. Specifically, this study examines the emergence of new civil society institutions within the historical context of extensive mangrove deforestation for the expansion of shrimp farming, policy changes in the late 1990s that recognized ""ancestral"" rights of local communities to mangrove resources, and how custodias, community-managed mangrove concessions, affect the cockle fishery. Findings from interviews with shell collectors and analysis of catchper-unit-effort (CPUE) indicate that mangrove concessions as common property regimes promote community empowerment, local autonomy over resources, mangrove conservation and recovery, higher cockle catch shares, and larger shell sizes, but the benefits are not evenly distributed. Associations without custodias and independent cockle collectors feel further marginalized by the loss of gathering grounds, potentially deflecting problems of overexploitation to ""openaccess"" areas, in which mangrove fisheries are weakly managed by the State. Using Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, the explicit link between social and ecological systems is studied at different levels, examining the relationship between collective action and the environment through quantitative approaches at the fishery level and qualitative analysis at the level of the mangrove landscape.

878,"Fishers' perceptions, facilitating factors and challenges of community-based no-take zones in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve, Quintana Roo, Mexico","In response to fisheries decline in the Mexican Caribbean and continuing deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef, conservation NGOs have begun to negotiate and collaboratively design a network of no-take zones (NTZs) with three fishing cooperatives in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR), among other places along the coast of Quintana Roo. Spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) is the target of the main fishery within cooperative concessions. Fishers are uniquely positioned to enforce and monitor NTZs and evaluate their effectiveness. This study analyzes fishers' perceptions as indicators of social acceptance of NTZs, and identifies facilitating factors and challenges of the community-based process. Consistent with similar studies, responses of fishers (89 out of a population of 124) to a semi-structured interview showed that perceptions of NTZs largely reflect fishers' concerns and interests. A high proportion of fishers accurately identified main NTZ objectives of regulation, conservation and economic improvement, as well as NTZ locations. Further, fishers cared about ecosystem sustainability and, because NTZs would not significantly limit their main economic activity, endorsed the initiative while expecting additional benefits. Declining trends in lobster catch influenced a perceived need for NTZs. Major concerns were that illegal fishers would reap NTZ benefits and that economic impacts and benefits were uncertain. Most fishers found the decision-making process inclusive, were willing to take responsibility for enforcing NTZs and believed people leading the process were trustworthy. Differences in endorsement of NTZs among cooperatives points to the importance of understanding fishers' incentives to collaborate, and the leadership and organizational dynamics which shape participatory processes. This analysis highlights challenges in advancing NTZs in complex ecological, socio-economic and regulatory contexts. It underscores the need for community-based processes that transcend understanding of conservation measures but also invests in sustainable, operative and trustful working relationships, as well as the urgency of interdisciplinary approaches in ensuring effective design and implementation of this relatively new fishery management tool.

879,Starting point or solution? Community-based marine protected areas in the Philippines,"In 1985, in response to declining coral reef conditions, local residents and officials established small, no-take marine sanctuaries on Balicasag and Pamilacan Islands through a community-based process. The implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) on Balicasag and Pamilacan Islands has been a partial success. As a direct result of protection, living hard coral cover has increased by 119% in Balicasag's sanctuary and by 67% in the non-sanctuary during the period 1984 to 1999, but Balicasag's reef is increasingly affected by breakage from anchors from dive boats and Crown-of-thorns starfish infestations. During the same period, living hard coral cover decreased by 20% in Pamilacan's sanctuary and by 45% in the non-sanctuary from 1984 to 1999. The decrease in living hard coral cover in Pamilacan's sanctuary is most likely a result of the 1998 bleaching event, Crown-of-thorn starfish and possible storm damage. Although there was an initial increase in the economically important target fish abundance in the Balicasag sanctuary and non-sanctuary and in the Pamilacan sanctuary during the first two years of implementation in the mid-1980s, there has since been a significant decline. Mean target fish abundance for the Balicasag non-sanctuary at 230 (Ã‚Â± 65) individuals per 500 m2 is not significantly different from control sites without MPAs on nearby Panglao and Cabilao Islands at 164 (Ã‚Â± 67) individuals per 500 m2. In general, fish abundance and diversity inside and outside the sanctuaries peaked in 1986, a year after the establishment of the sanctuaries when enforcement was strictest. Therefore, despite considerable success in enforcing regulations associated with these small MPAs at Balicasag and Pamilacan Islands, a trend of declining fish abundance and species richness among economically valuable species immediately outside the no-take areas highlights the limitations of small and isolated MPAs. This study contributes to the growing sentiment that it is not realistic for scattered, small no-take areas to maintain fish abundance and diversity on surrounding reefs when intensive fishing effort immediately adjacent to no-take areas removes most fish that exit these areas. This finding emphasizes the importance of nesting individual MPAs within broader management regimes that lead to overall fishing effort reduction and networking of MPAs. Among other recommendations, the authors advocate for continued support for community-based MPAs, a network of MPAs, reduced fishing effort in areas surrounding the MPAs and other management measures to improve the quality of the coral reef habitats.

880,"Barriers, facilitators, and opportunities to promote healthy weight behaviors among preschool-aged children in two rural U.S communities","Background: Obesity levels are higher in rural versus urban children. Multi-level community-based interventions can be effective in promoting healthy child weight, but few of such interventions have focused on rural children. This formative study assessed barriers, facilitators, and opportunities to promote healthy child weight in two rural communities. Methods: Multiple data collection methods were used concurrently in two rural communities in Indiana and North Carolina. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with participants, including parents of children aged 2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5Ã‚Â years (n = 41), childcare providers (n = 13), and stakeholders from 23 community organizations. Observational audits were conducted at 19 food outlets (grocery stores) and 50 publicly-accessible physical activity resources. Focus groups/interviews were analyzed thematically. Surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics, FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exact test, and t-tests. Results: Family level barriers included limited financial resources and competing priorities, whereas parental role-modeling was perceived as a facilitator of healthy weight behaviors. At the organizational level, childcare providers and community stakeholders cited limited funding and poor parental engagement in health promotion programs as barriers. Childcare providers explained that they were required to comply with strict nutrition and physical activity guidelines, but expressed concerns that similar messages were not reinforced at home. Facilitators at the organizational level included healthy meals provided at no cost at childcare programs, and health promotion programs offered through community organizations. At the community level, lack of public transportation, and limited access to healthy food outlets and physical activity-promoting resources posed barriers, whereas existing physical activity resources (e.g.,Ã‚Â parks) and some ongoing investment to improve physical activity resources in the community were assets. In designing/implementing a potential child obesity prevention intervention, participants discussed the need to garner community trust, emphasize wellness instead of obesity prevention, establish community partnerships, and leverage existing community resources.

881,Sustaining small-scale fisheries with periodically harvested marine reserves,"Spatial marine closures are widely employed and advocated for marine resource management and conservation. Temporal, non-permanent, rotational or periodically harvested area closures have been employed across the Indo. -Pacific for centuries and are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks. Although prior evidence suggests that periodic closures may confer fisheries benefits for some taxa or in certain conditions, there is little evidence that they are equally effective for the sustainable management of the many types of small-scale fisheries important in the Indo-Pacific. Case studies of periodic closures are reviewed to highlight the variations in target species, harvesting periodicity and fishing pressure that will influence the fisheries management effectiveness of this tool. Fisheries management benefits are observed for short-lived, fast-growing taxa or for a range of taxa in low fishing pressure situations. Stocks declines are observed for long-lived taxa or for a range of taxa if harvesting is intense. It is argued that community-based and co-management policy and action must better account for these factors when promoting and implementing periodic closures for medium- to long-term fisheries management or conservation goals.

882,"Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lies build trustÃ¢â‚¬Â: Social capital, masculinity, and community-based resource management in a Mexican fishery","This paper relates how fishermen in San Evaristo on Mexico's Baja peninsula employ fabrications to strengthen bonds of trust and navigate the complexities of common pool resource extraction. We argue this trickery complicates notions of social capital in community-based natural resource management, which emphasize communitarianism in the form of trust. Trust, defined as a mutual dependability often rooted in honesty, reliable information, or shared expectations, has long been recognized as essential to common pool resource management. Despite this, research that takes a critical approach to social capital places attention on the activities that foster social networks and their norms by arguing that social capital is a process. A critical approach illuminates San EvaristeÃƒÂ±o practices of lying and joking across social settings and contextualizes these practices within cultural values of harmony. As San EvaristeÃƒÂ±os assert somewhat paradoxically, for them Ã¢â‚¬Å“lies build trust.Ã¢â‚¬Â Importantly, a critical approach to this case study forces consideration of gender, an overlooked topic in social capital research. San EvaristeÃƒÂ±a women are excluded from the verbal jousting through which men maintain ties supporting their primacy in fishery management. Both men's joke-telling and San EvaristeÃƒÂ±osÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aversion to conflict have implications for conservation outcomes. As a result, we use these findings to help explain local resistance to outsiders and external management strategies including land trusts, fishing cooperatives, and marine protected areas.

883,Potential profitability of pearl culture in coastal communities in Tanzania,"Artisanal half-pearl culture has been shown to provide livelihood and economic opportunities for coastal communities in Tanzania that depend directly on exploitation of marine resources. However, these pilot research studies have been supported by donor organisations and the economic feasibility of such development has not yet been assessed. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the costs required to establish pearl farms and the relative impacts of farm size on production, running costs, profitability and risks involved in production. The aim of this study was to develop economic models for subsistence level half-pearl culture in Tanzania. Models were generated for various scenarios relating to farm size and products (i.e. half-pearls and juvenile oyster or Ã¢â‚¬ËœspatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ collection) and they give detail on infrastructure costs, operational costs and income generated for various levels of operation. We concluded that the most profitable model for community-based pearl farming is to culture at least 600 oysters for half-pearl production. However, for communities to be able to run a sustainable and profitable enterprise, development of a sustainable source of oysters is crucial. Farmers can also generate income from collection of juvenile oysters and their subsequent sale to pearl farmers, but this is less profitable than half-pearl farming and requires a longer operational period before profits are made. Like pearl farming, there were major benefits or economies of scale with the largest farms tested providing greatest profit and/or a shorter time required to reach profitability. Our results provide a valuable source of information for prospective pearl farmers, donors, funding bodies and other stakeholders, and valuable extension information supporting further development of pearl culture in Tanzania.

884,"How citizen scientists can enrich freshwater science as contributors, collaborators, and co-creators","The involvement of volunteers in aspects of freshwater research and monitoring has a long history. However, the advent of smart technology and access to the internet has opened up the possibility of mass public participation in science, termed citizen science. The potential of citizen science to generate data over wider spatial and temporal scales than conventional approaches is well recognized. However, as the field of citizen science has matured, more attention is being given to the participant journey, and how practitioners can maximize engagement. The papers in this special series on citizen science and freshwater are collected from a range of initiatives, with each study operating in different environments and engaging with citizens with contrasting socioeconomic circumstances. Many of the studies result in insights into freshwater biodiversity (e.g., amphibians, fish, wetland birds), whereas others explore the abiotic environment (e.g., water quality, flow regimes). In addition, several papers assess volunteer participation dynamics and provide guidance for those considering the use of citizen science. The use of citizen science in freshwater science is growing and so too is the quality of the scientific outputs. In part, this growth has been caused by a gradual evolution and expansion in the approach, which involves volunteers as contributors, collaborators, and co-creators. This flexibility holds great promise for opening a new source of valuable freshwater data and knowledge.

886,Examining enabling conditions for community-based fisheries comanagement: Comparing efforts in hawai'i and American Samoa,"Much attention in global fisheries management has been directed toward increasing the involvement of local communities in managing marine resources. Although community-based fisheries comanagement has the potential to address resource conservation and societal needs, the success of these programs is by no means guaranteed, and many comanagement regimes have struggled. Although promising in theory, comanagement programs meet a variety of political, social, economic, ecological, and logistical challenges upon implementation. We have provided an analysis of two community-based fisheries comanagement initiatives: Hawai'i's Community- Based Subsistence Fishing Area (CBSFA) legislation and American Samoa's Community-Based Fisheries Management Program (CFMP). Although Hawai'i's initiative has struggled with only two CBSFAs designated, neither of which has an approved management plan, American Samoa's program has successfully established a functioning network of 12 villages. We have explored the factors contributing to the divergent outcomes of these initiatives, including cultural and ethnic diversity, the intactness of traditional tenure systems and community organizing structures, local leadership, and government support. Differences in program design, including processes for program implementation and community involvement, supportive government institutions, adequate enforcement, and adaptive capacity, have also played important roles in the implementation of comanagement regimes on the two island groups. The different outcomes manifested in these case studies provide insight regarding the conditions necessary to enable successful communitybased comanagement, particularly within U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions.

887,"Understanding relational politics in MPA governance in northeastern Iloilo, Philippines","The Philippines archipelago is an important centre of tropical coastal marine biodiversity. Since the 1970s, various national and international actors have popularised marine protected areas (MPAs) as an effective tool for coastal conservation, tourism and even social empowerment. Scholars and practitioners however, overlook the different actors and complex institutions that frame and contest MPA design, implementation and outcomes. Pursuing apolitical perspectives and strategies in MPA governance and management, in turn, lead to continued environmental destruction and impoverished small-scale fishers. This paper describes the resources, power and relationship of key actors in MPA decision-making in four sites in northeastern Iloilo Province, Philippines. The paper explains that state-led, community-based and co-managed MPAs in the case study sites are socially constructed and contested. In such MPA spaces, actors have complex negotiations that have diverse and uncertain socio-political and ecological results. It is argued, however, that unless state and non-state actors link improved coastal ecosystem management, effective MPA governance and opportunities to enhance local livelihoods, then existing institutional arrangements will unlikely promote social justice and equity. In addition the major ecological effects of the Solar 1-Petron oil spill of August, 2006 are described and the potential implications of the disaster to the institutional resilience of MPA management systems are evaluated.",NA,No,"The paper's case study is based in the Philippines, not in any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is clearly focused on a case study from the Philippines, which is not one of the countries listed in the SC.

888,More than one bag for the world fishery crisis and keys for co-management successes in selected artisanal Latin American shellfisheries,"Global concerns about the depletion of marine stocks have been widely documented in industrial fisheries. However, small-scale artisanal fisheries constitute a second component for the world fishery crisis, normally ignored or erroneously lumped into the industrial component. In this paper we first present a brief comparison between industrial and artisanal fisheries, highlighting the differences between them and the differential feasibility for implementing management options. We propose that industrial and artisanal fishery problems have to be treated separately and thus cannot be lumped into a single ""fishing bag"". Among artisanal fisheries, we focus on coastal benthic shellfisheries, highlighting that their sedentary or sessile nature make them amenable to implement spatially-explicit management tools such as rotation of areas and territorial user rights (TURFs). Then, using long-term catch trends and selected examples, we demonstrate the power and validity of co-management for some Latin American shellfisheries, notably in Chile and Mexico, and stress the need to institutionalize the existent fishery knowledge. Several idiosyncratic properties of co-management in our Latin American examples have been useful to sustain the resources over time, including: (a) allocations of TURFs, (b) Community Fishery Quotas, which may be sub-allocated to families, (c) community-based and family-oriented sociological and organizational context of co-management, which may drive short and long-term market forces.

All preparations for constructing and installing the set-net in the coastal waters off Mae Rumpheung beach, Rayong Province, Thailand, were carried out by local fishers, with technical advice and support from national and international institutions. The gear was modified and developed to suit the conditions of the fishing ground and target species. Data on the catch and sales trends in Rayong using the set-net were collected for 7 years for statistical analysis; during this period, the gear design and marketing strategies were improved. Simulation analysis for evaluating the cost-profit bases was conducted to establish a model for set-net technology transfer in Southeast Asia, based on differing numbers of fishers and operation days. The simulation results show the required size of the average daily catch to cover the total cost according to the average unit price, where the economic return point is an average catch of 128 kg, based on a unit price of 25 Baht/kg (0.83 USD/kg), with ten fishermen and a daily operation cost of 3,200 Baht (USD 106.17).

893,Small-scale managed marine areas over time: Developments and challenges in a local Fijian reef fishery,"This paper investigates the Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) approach through looking at developments and challenges of community-based marine resource management over time, with a particular focus on Fiji in the South Pacific region. A diachronic perspective, based on two multi-method empirical studies, is used to exemplify the social complexities of the implementation of this LMMA approach in a specific island setting. This perspective connects local stakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ establishment and management of a LMMA covering their entire customary fishing rights area (iqoliqoli) with the national context articulated around the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Area (FLMMA) network, as well as with regional networking and international conservation dynamics. It especially explores the impacts of a small-scale marine closure (so-called tabu area) on the harvesting patterns in a portion of this LMMA, related aspects of formal and informal enforcement, and villagersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ views of the health of their reef fishery. This case study reveals a lack of consensus on the current management of this closure as a conditionally-opened no-take area, whose temporary openings (re)produce social tensions, as well as a lack of consensus on the effects of this closure on the reef fishery, which is subject to poaching. The paper highlights that the articulation between conservation and extraction of marine resources, as well as between short-term and longer-term objectives of the community-based marine resource management in place, is a complex sociopolitical process even at the most local level. The discussion also points out that local observations and interpretations of coastal resource dynamics, and of the interplay between fishery and community changes, might be instrumental in addressing the limits of the area-based system of management inherent in the LMMA approach. These insights into both the development process of the LMMA approach and the challenges of its local implementation and maintenance efforts can be useful to consider the adjustments necessary for Fiji's achievement of its national coastal fisheries management strategy and its international ocean governance commitments.

894,"Leatherback Ecotourism Development, Implementation, and Outcome Assessment in St. Kitts, West Indies","The St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network (SKSTMN) is a community-based sea turtle conservation organization operating in St. Kitts, West Indies. Four species of either nesting and/or foraging sea turtles have been recorded in the area around St. Kitts, including leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and loggerhead (Caretta caretta). An open fishing season for sea turtles is active in St. Kitts and Nevis from 1 October through 28 February annually. In 2006, sea turtle fishers in St. Kitts were assessed by the SKSTMN through a survey process to determine the status of sea turtle stocks in the St. Kitts area and to determine the feasibility of developing a local community-based ecotourism project focusing on sea turtles. Based on the results of this survey, the SKSTMN made the decision to develop alternative livelihoods for the fishers to serve as a replacement for the harvest. These included a Sea Turtle Technician Program and a St. Kitts Leatherback Ecotour Package. Prior to the development and implementation of the St. Kitts Leatherback Ecotour Package, a representative survey was prepared and distributed to 3 target groups: local citizens, tourists, and residents.

896,Integrating coastal vulnerability and community-based subsistence resource mapping in Northwest Alaska,"Subsistence resources are critical for indigenous communities in the Kotzebue Sound region of NW Alaska. Global sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal erosion are likely to create unfavorable and hazardous conditions for coastal and estuarine settlements. It is unclear how SLR and erosion might affect coastal subsistence resources because of highly complex ecological interactions. This study integrates physical, anthropological, and survey data to assess coastal vulnerability and to identify areas of concern for local and regional planning and environmental protection. This study analyzes and integrates historical and projected physical coastal changes within the Kotzebue Sound region with (1) a coastal vulnerability index (CVI); (2) community-based participatory GIS maps of community subsistence resources; and (3) representative surveys of local communities to determine the importance of each type of resource. The results identify Kivalina and Deering as particularly vulnerable coastal locations among four studied villages. While the CVI is high in these locations, low erosion rates will not likely have any negative impact on fish and caribou-two of the most important subsistence resource species for these communities. Because of the higher number of identified subsistence resource species, Deering is more resilient than Kivalina to any potential negative coastal impacts. This methodology can be useful in other coastal areas where subsistence resources play a major part in people's lives.

897,Transforming reef fisheries management: Application of an ecosystem-based approach in the USA Caribbean,"Fisheries in Puerto Rico and the United States (US) Virgin Islands are predominately dependent on nearshore coral reef ecosystems and have suffered from historical overfishing. The unique characteristics of reef fisheries, including strong habitat dependence, susceptibility to coastal impacts, diffuse landing sites and strong multispecies and multigear interactions suggest that standard approaches to fisheries management, especially those typically considered by the US Regional Fishery Management Councils, would not be applicable. Current management authority is split between local and federal agencies; however, there exists no uniform context and direction to current management initiatives, which results in lost efficiencies and opportunities. Proposed here is a new vision for fisheries management that takes into consideration the local ecological and socioeconomic characteristics of fishing, is compatible with regional resources and capacity, is ecosystem based and targets full stakeholder participation. Only an ecosystem-based approach can lead fisheries management out of the trap of unrealistic data collection and analysis demands, while at the same time refocusing emphasis away from attitudes and practices that promote overfishing. Management must be based on first principles regarding the desired state of the ecosystem and initiate strategies based on these principles. The key management goal is not to maximize fisheries catch, but to maintain the ecosystem in a state that will lead to sustained production. First principles would include maintaining ecosystem integrity and function, protecting all habitats and water quality, applying the precautionary approach, monitoring reference points and recognizing that production has limits. Resulting management tactics include marine reserves (to meet multiple goals), closed spawning aggregations, gear restrictions to maintain trophic balance and habitats, targeted data collection and assessments, adopting co-management practices and using ecosystem or community-based metrics. Fisheries management must fully incorporate the tools, resources and methods available within coastal zone management and other environmental agencies, while standards within those programmes must protect ecosystem health. Implementation will require attending to structural barriers inherent within existing fisheries legislation and regulations, multiple jurisdictions and the current cultures of scientists, managers and fisherfolk. Initial efforts should focus on developing a common language and frame of reference for all stakeholders.

The objectives of the study were to assess fishing activities and the impact of fishing on the Nile tilapia fish species in Lake Hayq. A total of 198 fishermen selected randomly from Kebeles bordering Lake Hayq were used as respondents for structured questionnaires. In addition to this, 30 fish traders and 8 fish hotel owners specialized in fish dish were used as key informants. The average age of fishermen was around 36 which were in active force age group (< 65 years). Most (97%) of the fishermen used gillnets imported from Egypt with mesh size of 4-6 cm stretched mesh size < 8 cm which is the national standard. There are three commercially important fish species, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and Catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Fishery of Lake Hayq is being used as source of livelihoods for about 2000 people living around the lake. Tehulederie, the largest district bordering the lake has established three months (May-July) as breeding seasons, however, the fishermen didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t respect the regulation set by the district.

900,Coastal management challenges from a community perspective: The problem of 'stealth privatization' in a Canadian fishery,"Intertidal clam fisheries seem ideal candidates for the devolution of management authority from government to local stakeholders. In St. Mary's Bay, Nova Scotia, a private firm recently applied for a 10-year renewal of a large (1,627 ha) lease for quahog clam aquaculture. This case study examines the challenges of implementing community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in rural fisheries within a broad integrated coastal management (ICM) institutional environment that favours corporate stakeholders. The challenges facing clam harvesters in rural Digby Neck, Nova Scotia arise from poor communication and coordination within government and between government and communities, as well as higher-level policy conflicts. The most important challenge arises from 'stealth privatization' of clam beaches. A single firm was granted rights of first refusal to depurate all clams harvested from closed (polluted) beaches in the region, resulting in the de facto privatization of all (polluted and unpolluted) clam beaches. Experiences in other parts of Canada suggest there may be community-based governance approaches that avoid the pitfalls associated with corporate management of clam beaches. New thinking is required about how to moderate the 'privatization paradigm' so prevalent within senior levels of government in order to ensure environmental and social sustainability in rural fishing communities.

901,Community-based management and technical advice in Patos Lagoon estuary (Brazil),"The Forum of Patos Lagoon, a multi-partner entity, was established in 1996 to organize the fishery sector of the estuary of Patos Lagoon (Brazil). Through the Forum, a strong link between fishermen and researchers has been established. Some research projects are being developed according to the needs of the fishermen. To develop research projects related to community needs means to produce results in a short time even in the absence of accurate scientific data. The use of the precautionary approach is fundamental in these situations. Results of the research are presented to the fishermen, and the possible management alternatives and the consequences of each alternative appear after intensive discussions with the fishermen, backed by the scientific knowledge supported by the traditional knowledge. Research results constitute the framework under which the suggestions and opinions from fishermen and other fishery-related groups will help to build the most adequate management solution. Fishermen are involved in resources management from the beginning of the process, discussing the problems, the alternatives to solve the problems and the consequences of each alternative. Decision-making is a collective process and responsibilities are shared. Although not all the community needs will be satisfied as well as not all the science requirements will be attained, the objective is, in fact, to find a way to adjust community needs to science requirements, aiming ecological balance, social justice and economic return.

Rural in nature, 50% of the population resides in widely-dispersed communities of less than 2500 people. The economy traditionally relied on the fishing industry, but with the closure of the once lucrative cod fishery in 1991, the poorest province in Canada faced a difficult economic climate with up to 20% unemployment rates. With little funding available to supplement or sustain expensive initiatives, the Demonstration Phase of the Newfoundland and Labrador Heart Health Program (1990-1996) focused on how community-based programs are developed and sustained, with a view to diffusion throughout the province.

903,A Sustainable Tourism Based on a New Institutional Economics Approach: Ecotourism Based on the Community in the Gasan Gadang Fishermen Village,"This study aimed to determine the patterns of development and implementation of community-based ecotourism management and identify the impact of the community-based ecotourism in Gasan Gadang Village on the economic, social, and environmental aspects of the surrounding community. The methodology used was descriptive analysis with a new institutional economics approach and the Kruskal-Wallis Test analysis. The patterns of development and implementation of community-based ecotourism management with all levels of social change analysis, including formal and informal rules such as culture, customs, habits of Gasan Gadang villagers, institutional and governance management, and even the economy, are considered good. The Community-based ecotourism management has adopted the theory of resource allocation among stakeholders of Gasan Gadang Village. The findings of this study showed that community-based ecotourism institutions and management bring positive impacts on economic, social, and culture. There was no significant difference among economic, social, and environmental impacts between the non-authorities and community-based ecotourism authorities of Gasan Gadang Village. Thus, it could be said that the benefits of community-based ecotourism received by the community were all the same. Everyone got positive benefits. However, based on the findings, it could be seen that the biggest difference was the economic impacts followed by the social impacts, while the smallest difference is the environmental impacts. From this situation, it could be concluded that the performance of community-based ecotourism authorities in Gasan Gadang Village was good and positively impacted the economic, social, and environmental aspects of the Gasan Gadang Village fishermen community.

909,Opportunities to Strengthen Fish Supply Chain Policy to Improve External Food Environments for Nutrition in the Solomon Islands,"Malnutrition and food insecurity have significant social and economic impacts in small island developing states, such as the Solomon Islands. Enhancing the domestic supply of fish, the main source of local protein, can contribute to improved nutrition and food security. This research aimed to improve understanding of the policy interface between the fisheries and health sectors and identify opportunities to strengthen fish supply chain policy to improve domestic (particularly urban) access to fish in the Solomon Islands. The study design drew on theories of policy learning and policy change and analysed policies using a consumption-oriented supply chain approach. Interviews were conducted with 12 key informants in the Solomon Islands, and 15 policy documents were analysed. Analysis of policy documents and interview data indicated that there were strengths as well as opportunities in the existing policy context. In particular, community-based fisheries management approaches and explicit recognition of the links between fisheries and nutrition were key strengths. Challenges included gaps in implementation, variations in capacities across government actors and communities, and limited attention to domestic monitoring and enforcement. Improving the effectiveness of resource management efforts may result in sustainable outcomes for both livelihoods and health, which will accomplish priorities at the national and sub-national levels and support the achievement of the Solomon IslandsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals.

913,Ma Kahana ka 'Ike: Lessons for community-based fisheries management,"Indigenous and place-based communities worldwide have self-organized to develop effective local-level institutions to conserve biocultural diversity. How communities maintain and adapt these institutions over time offers lessons for fostering more balanced human-environment relationships-an increasingly critical need as centralized governance systems struggle to manage declining fisheries. In this study, we focus on one long-enduring case of local level fisheries management, in Kahana, on themost populated Hawaiian island of O'ahu. We used a mixed-methods approach including in-depth interviews, archival research, and participation in community gatherings to understand how relationships with place and local governance have endured despite changes in land and sea tenure, and what lessons this case offers for other communities engaged in restoring local-level governance. We detail the changing role of konohiki (head fishermen) in modern times (1850-1965) when they were managing local fisheries, not just for local subsistence but for larger commercial harvests. We also highlight ways in which families are reclaiming their role as caretakers following decades of state mismanagement. Considerations for fisheries co-management emerging from this research include the importance of (1) understanding historical contexts for enhancing institutional fit, (2) enduring community leadership, (3) balancing rights and responsibilities, and (4) fostering community ability to manage coastal resources through both formal and informal processes.

914,Small scale fisheries management: Lessons from cockle harvesters in Nicaragua and Tanzania,"The role of women in gleaning fisheries tends to be underestimated and poorly documented although they play an important role in coastal food security and income generation. This article describes two initiatives for co-management of women dominated cockle (Anadara spp.) fisheries implemented in Zanzibar Island of Tanzania and in Nicaragua that were based on a Fiji model. In each case, significant progress was made at the pilot scale but required adaptation to the community and national context. The Nicaragua case resulted in increasing densities of cockles inside and outside small scale no-take zones in a small estuary after a two-year period of implementation. In Zanzibar, out of several no-take sites established on reef flats, only one showed similar results. Other sites' poor performance is likely due to poor site selection, small size, and non-compliance. Varying degrees of poaching affected both locations and continues to be an issue. In Zanzibar, local and national government played highly supporting roles whereas in Nicaragua, local government was supportive but national government continues to exhibit top-down decision-making, while still evaluating the alternative co-management approach. In both cases, university extension initiatives were influential in building community capacity for management and playing an advocacy role with national government. Both locations are poised for scaling up to more geographic sites as well as fostering policy change that can lead to more integrated and ecosystem-scale approaches to sustainable fisheries management.

The survey identified at least 260 species and 25 families among over 14,000 individual catch- and gear-specific fish photos taken using a digital image capture system. Seventy-nine fishers provided 175 catches during surveys and more than 1,600 fisher and vendor interviews were conducted. More than 75% of all individual fish sampled belonged to nine families that included groupers (Epinephelidae) with 29 species and snappers (Lutjanidae) with 28 species. Groupers, snappers and emperors (Lethrinidae) dominated line-caught fish, while speared catch was composed primarily of parrotfish (Scaridae) and surgeonfish and unicornfish (Acanthuridae). Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) was 3.9 Ã‚Â± 0.1 kg hrÃ¢Ë†â€™1 fisherÃ¢Ë†â€™1 overall, with the highest CPUE for line fishing at 4.5 Ã‚Â± 1.6 kg hrÃ¢Ë†â€™1 and lowest CPUE for nighttime spearfishing (2.1 Ã‚Â± 0.4 kg hrÃ¢Ë†â€™1). Gear-specific size distributions and species targeted varied widely, with juveniles dominating most catches for speared fish. Between line-caught and speared catch, only two species were common within the top 25 species. At the time of the study there were no enacted national regulations related to finfish in the inshore fishery in Solomon Islands. Community-based management approaches have been endorsed by government and non-government entities in Solomon Islands, however a greater level of community engagement and voluntary fisher compliance is needed in concert with government enforcement to control potential overfishing, particularly nighttime spearfishing.

916,Strong historical and ongoing indigenous marine governance in the northeast pacific ocean: A case study of the kitasoo/xaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais first nation,"Indigenous marine governance is increasingly recognized as having a crucial role in marine management and conservation, yet most examples are from the tropical Pacific and Oceania. We showcase strong and ongoing marine governance by the Kitasoo/ XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais people of British Columbia, Canada. In partnership with the Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais Stewardship Authority, we synthesized information about marine governance by the Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais people as collated in their Heritage Database, a compilation of interviews and recordings with knowledge holders, traditional stories, and historical documents, e.g., journals of explorers and anthropologists. We found that Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais marine governance underpinned sustainable resource use and has remained strong despite colonial efforts to undermine it. Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais marine governance flows from the underlying principles of their indigenous law that guide all actions in the traditional territory. The social institutions of the Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais people are the mechanism for implementing marine governance: Importantly, hereditary chiefs hold key responsibilities regarding management of the oceans, embedded in ownership of specific places, passed on through names and stories. Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais protocols exist for respecting their territories, those of other nations, and the plants and animals being harvested. There are natural and spiritual consequences for not accessing and sharing marine resources in a way that follows Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais underlying principles, including loss of access. Contemporary examples of marine governance include the work of Kitasoo/XaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢xais Stewardship Authority, the Food Fish Committee guided by hereditary chiefs and elders, and everyone's actions to defend their territory from external threats.

917,Synergies between local and climate-driven impacts on coral reefs in the Tropical Pacific: A review of issues and adaptation opportunities,"Coral reefs in the tropical Pacific region are exposed to a range of anthropogenic local pressures. Climate change is exacerbating local impacts, causing unprecedented declines in coral reef habitats and bringing negative socio-economic consequences to Pacific communities who depend heavily on coral reefs for food, income and livelihoods. Continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions will drive future climate change, which will accelerate coral reef degradation. Traditional systems of resource governance in Pacific island nations provide a foundation to address local pressures and build reef resilience to climate change. Management and adaptation options should build on the regional diversity of governance systems and traditional knowledge to support community-based initiatives and cross-sectoral cooperation to address local pressures and minimize climate change impacts.

918,Fisheries co-management in hilsa shad sanctuaries of Bangladesh: Early experiences and implementation challenges,"Community-based fisheries management has long been practiced in the management of the inland fisheries of Bangladesh. However, formal coastal co-management has only been implemented recently in hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) sanctuaries. The study analysed the pre-implementation processes, institutional arrangements, implementation activities, as well as challenges for fisheries co-management that are currently being implemented in the Padma-Meghna riverine-estuarine system. As a first step in establishing a co-management system in hilsa shad sanctuaries, communities (both fishing villages and fish landing centres) were selected for interventions. Co-management committees were formed from the community-village to district level with the defined tasks of developing plans and programs, implementing management rules and regulations, monitoring compliance, and creating awareness in a cost-effective manner among various stakeholders. Still, the operationalization of co-management in this large riverine-estuarine system is a challenging task. To overcome these challenges, several issues had to be considered through lessons learned from previously implemented community-based fisheries management projects in Bangladesh. To ensure that fisheries co-management is functional, the institutional framework needs to be flexible with support from local government institutions and NGOs. The boundary of the management unit needs to be clearly defined and community-based organization also needs a clear legal status. To make co-management sustainable, a relationship of trust and respect among co-management partners needs to be developed and maintained. The effective implementation of fisheries co-management will require an inclusive compensation scheme that will motivate stakeholders to comply and maintain fisheries management efforts through collective action.

919,Institutional constraints to fishers resilience: community based fishery management in Bangladesh,"Community based fishery management (CBFM) formulates various formal and informal institutions (developing community organizations, decision-making, and traditional fishing rules) for sustainable fishery management in Bangladesh. Although these rules are intended to managing fisheries for a long-term use, constraints to enforcing these rules or absence of mechanisms to address these constraints hamper fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resilience. This paper aims to examine such constraints to fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resilience in Langalkata Ozur Beel (local name of the fishery), Sunamganj, Bangladesh. Based on key informant interviews, this paper finds that non-partici-patory community based organizations and weak coordination among stakeholders appear to be enduring constraints to developing fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resilience. FishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resilience is largely constrained by power relations that mostly exclude fishers from the fishery management. Conflict between fishery users or with the community and the absence of interactive learning are also important constraints to fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resilience. It seems that rules-in-practice fail to develop fishersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ capacity to cope and adapt to these constraints and continue their activities to maintaining the fishery.

920,Community-based planning: Canada's Atlantic Coastal Action Program (ACAP),"The Atlantic Coastal Action Program (ACAP) was established in 1991 by Environment Canada in Canada's four Atlantic provinces. Focusing on 13 designated areas, ACAP depends largely upon strong participation of local residents to manage coastal resources, as it attempts to build 'bottom-up' initiatives through the formation of stakeholder committees comprising a cross-section of community residents, local government officials and representatives from local businesses and academia. This paper reports the preliminary findings of research on ACAP, examining the growth of community participation in the Program and analysing the general development of the scheme. It concentrates primarily on three rural localities designated under ACAP, reporting interviews with local residents and analysing impacts upon local communities. It is suggested that, although participation in and awareness of the scheme by local residents is relatively limited, the groundwork has been laid for both more extensive community involvement and for further development of significant practical attempts to improve the quality of the environment. Much will depend on availability of funds once the 13 ACAP groups have prepared environmental management plans during 1996.",NA,No,"The paper is about a program in Canada, not a case study from any of the specified Pacific Island countries."," No; The paper is focused on Canada's Atlantic Coastal Action Program (ACAP), not on any of the listed Pacific Island countries.

921,Oil spill on the Brazilian coast: (in)visibility of knowledges and disregard for the life of shellfisherwomen [Derramamento de petrÃƒÂ³leo no litoral brasileiro: (in)visibilidade de saberes e descaso com a vida de marisqueiras],"In 2019, an oil spill of yet unknown origin affected several locations on the Brazilian coast. The purpose of this research was to capture the perceptions of women shellfish gatherers in the Jaguaribe River estuary, CearÃƒÂ¡, about exposure to oil and its consequences. The focal group technique was used for data collection and the Iramuteq software for the processing and analysis of the material. The results indicated the creation of two analytical categories: Social, economic, food production and consumption implications of shellfish gatherer families; and the knowledges, the participation and the surveillance in the context of (in) visibility of exposure to oil. It was observed that shellfisherwomen and their families constitute a population that is very exposed to the negative impacts caused by the oil spill, as they are significant from the socioeconomic, environmental, food production, consumption and health perspectives. Attention is drawn to health and social assistance policies for these fisherwomen/shellfish gatherers, with consequences on the food, water and nutrition security of families and the recognition of their knowledges and practices, constructed within a traditional way of life that produces and reproduces the existence in a close society/nature relationship.

On the basis of this small sample, the study endeavours to broaden current research perspectives to include the occupational safety and health perceptions of those working in small-scale, independent, community-based fishing businesses within the cultural milieu of the New Zealand fishing industry. The study also attempts to examine barriers to implementing two government occupational safety and health initiatives (Safe Ship Management and FishSAFE) in the New Zealand fishing industry, which reputedly has a strong organisational preventive culture and employs an ethnically diverse workforce. The findings highlight the fact that cultural dimensions and government programmes play a part in influencing the 'safety culture' of small fishing vessels. However, the findings expose a number of barriers to implementing and maintaining occupational safety and health measures, such as increasingly tight profit margins, time pressures and confusion around regulatory requirements.

923,Ensuring local stakeholder support for marine conservation: Establishing a locally-managed marine area network in Aceh,"Abstract Multidisciplinary approaches to managing seascapes are increasingly being recognized as best practice and therefore prioritized by conservation agencies. For most coastal areas the strengthening of customary marine tenure, rules and regulations should yield even greater biodiversity and livelihood benefits. Here, we present the conservation planning results from a locally-managed marine area programme initiated by the Government of Aceh, Indonesia, which aimed to empower coastal communities to sustainably and equitably manage marine resources with local government. In 2008 the government established a Marine and Fisheries Task Force to identify priority areas for marine biodiversity (through systematic conservation planning) and coastal communities (through participatory planning). In addition to the existing 264,788 ha of marine management units, systematic planning identified another 53,372 ha. However, the subsequent stakeholder participation phase, involving intensive local consultations, further expanded the locally-managed marine area network by 6,725 ha and to a total of 23 locally-managed marine areas. This combined approach had additional benefits because it generated a strong sense of local ownership. For communities it initiated a process for recognizing their customary claimed areas and resolved overlapping boundaries between neighbouring communities, thereby reducing the likelihood of future conflicts over natural resource use. For government, it provided the basis of a robust governance system, with 34 new or revised decrees being completed and an additional USD 1.6 million being allocated for implementation of locally-managed marine areas. This participatory approach should considerably increase the successful delivery of a sustainable and equitable locally-managed marine area network for Aceh, which has wide application for the South-east Asian region and beyond.

924,Social networks and transitions to co-management in Jamaican marine reserves and small-scale fisheries,"How social networks support or constrain the transition to co-management of small-scale fisheries and marine reserves is poorly understood. In this paper, we undertake a comparative analysis of the social network structures associated with the transition to co-management in three Jamaican marine reserves. Data from quantitative social relational surveys (n = 380) are integrated with data from semi-structured interviews (n = 63) and focus groups (n = 10) to assess how patterns of relational ties and interactions between and among fishermen and other local level actors (e.g., managers, wardens, NGO staff) support and constrain the transition to co-management. Our research suggests that the transitions to co-management were supported by a combination of three network structure and relational attributes: (i) the presence and position of institutional entrepreneurs; (ii) a dense central core of network actors; and (iii) the prevalence of horizontal ties and vertical linkages held by the community-based organizations formally responsible for the management of the marine reserves. Our findings also show that overall low network cohesion in the three reserves and limited social influence among the wardens may be problematic for sustained collective action that extends beyond the core set of network actors. These findings suggest the importance of strategies to enhance collective action, specifically through attention to the attributes of the corresponding social networks, as a means to contribute to successful transitions to co-management of marine reserves and small-scale fisheries. Our results provide more precise guidance, through social network analysis, on where in the respective networks social capital and leadership may require support or enhancement, and thus on how to target interventions for greatest effect.

925,A university-hosted program in pursuit of coastal sustainability: The case of Tokyo Bay,"This study presents a unique way by which a university program can contribute to capacity development for coastal sustainability. The program is steered by a working group of volunteer faculty members, having different academic backgrounds, in collaboration with students and marine professionals, including fisherfolk and environment education interpreters. Although the program began with conventional educational ideas and style, its practical framework evolved to include interactive activities with collaborators in the community, all of which were geared toward social learning. The combination of service learning and participatory action research (PAR) was proven to be an adequate approach to link higher education for sustainable development (HESD) and university-community partnerships and to promote learning for coastal sustainability. Challenges identified include (1) ensuring continuity of learning and (2) reducing the heavy workload of faculty members involved in program preparation and coordination.

926,Decentralization of fisheries management in Indonesia,"Decentralization is highly considered as an alternative to make better fisheries management. This is due to that decentralization appears as a means for increasing the efficiency and equity of development activities and services delivery, and also for promoting local participation and democracy. The evolution of decentralization of fisheries management policy in Indonesia showed that the decentralization was gradually developed from deconcentration and delegation to devolution form. After Reform Era, devolution form of decentralization has been implemented due to the enactment of UU 22/1999 (the Local Autonomy Law), where local government has gained the amount of new authorities concerning marine-fisheries management. By such devolution, however, the community based management system, which is rooted from traditional fishing communities, is recognized. The effectiveness of the community based management system for the marine resources sustainability is caused by the bottom up planning and participative approach that led to the increasing of the local fishers' sense of stewardship over the resources. Even though this kind of decentralization practice has been dealing with several problems, this is still a better way rather than centralization. This paper identifies some agendas are being encountered both in the central and the local level. This is related to the need of improvement of the legal framework, the capacity building of the local government, and the revitalization of the local institution. Ã‚Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

927,"Understanding barriers, access, and management of marine mixed-stock fisheries in an era of reconciliation: Indigenous-led salmon monitoring in British Columbia","Wild salmon are central to food security, cultural identity, and livelihoods of coastal Indigenous communities. Yet ongoing inequities in governance, declining fish populations, and mixed-stock ocean fisheries may pose challenges for equitable access between Indigenous fishers and other non-Indigenous fishers. We sought to understand current perceptions among HaÃƒÂ­Ã…â€šzaqv (Heiltsuk) fishers towards salmon fisheries and their management. We conducted dockside surveys with both HaÃƒÂ­Ã…â€šzaqv fishers and sport fishers, and in-depth interviews with HaÃƒÂ­Ã…â€šzaqv fishers, community members, and natural resource managers. From these surveys and interviews we quantified satisfaction among both food, social, and ceremonial fishers and visiting recreational fishers with the current salmon fishery and associated social-ecological drivers, and characterized perceptions among HaÃƒÂ­Ã…â€šzaqv people of salmon fisheries and management. Second, we synthesized community perceptions of the revitalization of terminal, communally run salmon fisheries within HaÃƒÂ­Ã…â€šzaqv territory as a tool for their future salmon management. Finally, we elicited information from HaÃƒÂ­Ã…â€šzaqv fishers about the barriers people in their community currently face in accessing salmon fisheries. Our findings suggest that low salmon abundance, increased fishing competition, and high costs associated with participation in marine mixed-stock fisheries currently hinder access and equity for HaÃƒÂ­Ã…â€šzaqv fishers. This community-based research can help strengthen local, Indigenous-led management of salmon into the future.

928,When predators become prey: Community-based monitoring of caiman and dolphin hunting for the catfish fishery and the broader implications on Amazonian human-natural systems,"Wildlife hunting for commercial products has been responsible for decline of many large vertebrates around the globe. An Amazonian example of this worldwide trend is the use of caiman and dolphins as bait for the piracatinga catfish fishery. While it is a controversial issue in Amazonia conservation, there is no data on key biological aspects, such as age and sex, of those animals illegally hunted for bait. This lack of data complicates understanding of the true impact of bait-hunting on the targeted species. In this study, we present results of one year of participatory monitoring of bait-hunting in 12 communities in the MamirauÃƒÂ¡ Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR), Brazilian Amazonia, during which participants recorded aspects of hunting activity and biometric data of animals used as piracatinga bait. The piracatinga fishery at MSDR has distinct spatial and seasonal patterns, being concentrated close to distribution centers and intensifying during the dry season. Adult male black caiman is the main bait used by fishermen, but viscera of commercial fish provide a potential alternative bait source for the piracatinga fishery. All recorded bait hunting was for caiman, none for dolphins. Despite the predominant use of caiman as bait, MSDR caiman populations remain the largest within the species' distribution. We suggest that informal management of caiman conducted by MSDR residents has guaranteed regional sustainability of the piracatinga fishery. In a broader context, the current study highlights the potential for participatory research with local populations in formulating well-informed decisions for the conservation of natural resources and economic alternatives focused on the conservation of human-natural systems.

929,Moving from data poor to data rich: A case study of community-based data collection for the san diego red sea urchin fishery,"Responding to the need for management of California's nearshore fisheries mandated in state law by the Marine Life Management and Marine Life Protection acts, the San Diego Watermen's Association (SDWA), which includes divers that target local red sea urchins Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, initiated a community-based data collection program in 2001 In collaboration with independent scientists and biologists from the California Department of Fish and Game, the SDWA developed an ongoing program to gather, organize, and analyze both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data on the local red sea urchin fishery. The goal of the program is to collect data that will support periodical stock assessments needed for sustainable management of existing nearshore fisheries (including red sea urchins) as well as the kelp forest ecosystem on which these fisheries depend. Here, we discuss sampling designs, methods for determining data quality (bias and precision), and methods for detecting change, and we provide some examples of results from the ongoing community-based data collection program. We also report on (1) the design and implementation of scientifically valid sampling protocols; (2) data quality assurance and control collaboratively conducted with scientists and resource agency biologists; (3) calibration studies to determine accuracy and precision and the magnitude of detectable changes in red sea urchin populations; and (4) visualization and dissemination of data and results and incremental changes in protocols that would facilitate the monitoring of associated biological communities.

931,Library Development Strategy for the Community at Coastal Areas,"This study aims to reveal various phenomena of the existence of libraries in coastal areas, especially to pay a particular attention to the relation power between various interests of the library, especially the managers and the community as the users and to explore how both parties understand and imagine the idea of library through the developing the library as a center of learning and skill development. The design of the research is explorative qualitative. Applying case study approach, the location of this research is in a coastal area, in the floating library of Tambak Lorok coastal, Semarang. Data are collected through observation and in-depth interviews with several parties involved. To examine the validity of data, this study applies a triangulation technique of sources focusing on key informants living in the community. The result of this research shows that the existence of library in the coastal area is more than the common belief to the function of library. Although finding shows that the government's attitude to support the development of the library has been as expected through producing some regulations, the response of the community to the development of the library is far beyond the expectation. Some drawbacks found are in the handling of library management which is still lack of implementation from the initial planning and the absence of integrated coastal resources management resulted from low understanding and mastery of policy makers and implementers of the national library program. However, the community has developed a community-based management which is an approach that has been widely used in various regions as an effort to empower themselves through utilizing any existed facilities, in this case is the library.

We analyze the origins and effectiveness of a community-based CPR system that has emerged despite several features that are, in Ostrom's view, barriers to local institutional development: the fish populations are migratory rather than stationary, spatial boundaries are ambiguous rather than fixed, and state support of local management is weak or non-existent rather than strong. We argue that cultural and political factors, which are given less emphasis in Ostrom's model, may help explain how these communities overcome barriers to collective action. We draw parallels between freshwater systems and Marine Protected Areas and discuss implications for local resource management.

933,Community-based fisheries management in Saroma Lake,"This chapter illustrated fisheries management dynamics in Saroma Lake and its surrounding territorial areas. Tracing back to the historical sketch in the Saroma Lake region, the fishers were succedded to develop highly productive and stable fisheries after opening of first mouth in 1929. Prior to the year 1929, they faced a crisis over environmental degradation due to overexploitation of fishery resources. For instance, repeated prohibitions of scallop fishieries were occurred in the region. Each fisher used to catch fish on a first-come-first-served basis. The less availability of fishery resources further induced them to operate fish catch indiscriminately, resulting in the negative cycle of fisheries management. In particular, smallscale fishers mainly as wage labors were exploited by their bosses, instead of supplying basic materials for survival as wel as money lending. The internal relationship between the two created exploitative economy situation under the ""boss system,"" which undermined fishers' adaptive capacity to the ecological-social-economic system. However, one of the bosses, who expressed interest with regard to future development of Saroma Lake fisheries, encouraged the fishers to unite together for operation of cooperative fish marketing. His long-range outlook as a result provided a foundation for promoting wise use of fishery resources and securing the health of the lagoon environment. The significant feature of fisheries management in Saroma Lake is a community-based approach in opposition to the case of Chilika Lagoon fisheries (state-based one). The CBFM is based on the establishment of ACLS which served as coordination of affiliated three FCAs. The introduction of ACLS took a lead in building cooperative fishery governance system among the fishers. It enabled to share their fishing grounds as CPRs in the lake beyond the boarder line of administrative territory, leading to strong sense of solidarity among three FCAs and among the fishers. Of course, the fishers faced with many challenges in the development process of breeding and culturing scallop fisheries. In particular, the massive death of cultured scallops and damages of drift ice endangered the management crisis of ACLS and FCAs. However, it is important to note that these problems were overcome and improved by community-based initiatives, rather state-based ones which were taken in many countries of the world (Ostrom, Burger, Field, Norgaard, & Policansky, 1999) as found in Chilika lagoon fisheries. The key operations have been in charge of ACLS that applied scientific-oriented ways through setting of several committees and built good partnership among various stakeholders. In the places where are vulnerable to environmental problems from internal (e.g., fishing operation) and external sources (e.g., water pollution from upstream and climate change), integrated fishery resources management needs to be taken into more consideration not just at the local level but at the regional and global levels. On the point of this, lessons learnt from Saroma Lake fisheries will provide potential implications on how important the presence of coordinator for fisheries management is.

934,Indigenous community-based fisheries in Australia,"The commercial sea cucumber species known as Sandfish (Holothuria scabra) occurs intertidally and subtidally in the Northern Territory of Australia, on or adjacent to Aboriginal land. A 4-yr program of community-based fisheries research with Aboriginal Australians was implemented to assess the viability of indigenous Australians' involvement in the wild-stock fishery. The research involved extensive and intensive indigenous participation, unusual in Australian biophysical sciences research, during field survey and habitat mapping, complemented by commercial catch data modelling and discussion of its implications. Field surveys produced Sandfish distribution and site-specific density, and revealed some areas that were not commercially fished. Catch data modelling results suggested that no additional effort could be sustained, however commercial fishers increased their effort, expanding their operations into the newly mapped areas. These actions effectively precluded indigenous peoples' aspirations of entry into the commercial fishery. The efficacy and outcomes of participatory program design with indigenous Australians need critique in the absence of the political will and statutory backing to provide equitable access to resources.

935,Mapping economic diversity in the First World: The case of fisheries,"Fisheries are understood within a binary frame that is both spatialized into the First and Third Worlds and founded upon a developmentalist discourse of fisheries that produces the conditions for capitalism. The result is an inevitable march toward privatization of resources abstractly understood and their utilization by individuals as capital. The Third World is allowed to diverge from this inevitability because of its inherent characteristics of subject and space read as fisheries-based community and territory. These different imaginaries of subject and space produce very different prescriptions for economic development; the First World must choose capitalism whereas the Third World might explore other options, albeit at a local scale. Producing alternative forms of fisheries management in the First World, then, requires both a strategy of valuing that which has been relegated to the periphery (for example, community, cooperation, and participation) as well as a blurring of binary categories generally. Undermining the presence of capitalism in the First World and making space for that which has been excluded (for example, community-based and territorial fisheries) requires a new economic and spatial imaginary.",NA,No,The paper does not mention a case study from any of the specified locations.," No; The abstract and title do not mention any of the specified locations.

936,Explanatory factors of adherence to community-based management of epilepsy in Lao PDR,"Relevance: A low level of knowledge about epilepsy among health workers, a context of stigmatizing sociocultural beliefs, and a low availability of antiepileptic drugs in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) are major gaps in the medical management of people with epilepsy in this country. Objectives: The principal objective of the study was to identify the associated factors of adherence to community healthcare structures in Lao PDR. Specific objectives were to evaluate patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ adherence status, practices and knowledge about epilepsy and its care, and factors influencing decision-making on therapeutic interventions. Materials and methods: The study was an observational cross-sectional survey about knowledge, attitudes, and practices, handled from February to May 2016. Eighty-seven people with epilepsy were identified in two areas in the periphery of Vientiane Capital through an active screening in villages and homes. Semidirective questionnaires were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative analysis included a comparison of adherent vs. nonadherent people with epilepsy, using Chi-square or Fisher's test. Advanced qualitative lexical analysis was carried out on the open-ended questions. Results: Sixty-two people with epilepsy were included and the adherence rate to community care was 67.7%. The only sociodemographic variable that differed significantly between adherent and nonadherent members was the income level (p = 0.015): the wealthiest class of people with epilepsy did not adhere to community healthcare. Eleven percent of people with epilepsy thought that epilepsy was contagious, 80.6% that medication may reduce epilepsy seizure rates, and 33.9% that it was possible to cure epilepsy permanently. Physicians informed about the disease in 69.0% of adherent people with epilepsy and in 40.0% of nonadherent ones (p = 0.029), whereas villagers were involved in 29.0% and 50.0% of cases, respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups for the prescribed antiepileptic drugs (p = 0.012): phenobarbital covered 73.8% of adherent people with epilepsy but only 40% of nonadherent ones. Half of nonadherent people with epilepsy went regularly to a central hospital in the Vientiane Capital, 15.0% went to Thailand, and 10.0% practiced self-medication in occasional mobilities. Conclusion: A wider range of antiepileptic drugs at a reduced cost and the promotion of adherence to community healthcare would allow a better management of people with epilepsy in Lao PDR.

937,Empowering Indigenous agency through community-driven collaborative management to achieve effective conservation: Hawai'i as an example,"Indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) around the world are increasingly asserting 'Indigenous agency' to engage with government institutions and other partners to collaboratively steward ancestral Places. Case studies in Hawai'i suggest that 'community-driven collaborative management' is a viable and robust pathway for IPLCs to lead in the design of a shared vision, achieve conservation targets, and engage government institutions and other organisations in caring for and governing biocultural resources and associated habitats. This paper articulates key forms of Indigenous agency embodied within Native Hawaiian culture, such as kua'Ã„Âina, hoa'Ã„Âina, and the interrelated values of aloha 'Ã„Âina, mÃ„Âlama 'Ã„Âina, and kia'i 'Ã„Âina. We also examine how Hawai'i might streamline the pathways to equitable and productive collaborative partnerships through: (1) a better understanding of laws protecting Indigenous rights and practices; (2) recognition of varied forms of Indigenous agency; and (3) more deliberate engagement in the meaningful sharing of power. We contend that these partnerships can directly achieve conservation and sustainability goals while transforming scientific fields such as conservation biology by redefining research practices and underlying norms and beliefs in Places stewarded by IPLCs. Further, collaborative management can de-escalate conflicts over access to, and stewardship of, resources by providing IPLCs avenues to address broader historical legacies of environmental and social injustice while restoring elements of self-governance. To these ends, we propose that government agencies proactively engage with IPLCs to expand the building of comprehensive collaborative management arrangements. Hawai'i provides an example for how this can be achieved.

938,The need to know what to manage-community-based marine resource monitoring in Fiji,"Overfishing threatens Fijian coral reefs, even those small island areas used mainly for subsistence fishing. Management is needed to ensure the future availability of fish, but means to quantify local pressures on the fishery (i.e., monitoring) are still lacking in most communities. The customary fishing rights system (including traditional authority and resource ownership) not only serves as a basis for management actions, but also has its drawbacks - and does not comprise monitoring. Fishing data collected between 2003 and 2009 on three islands in Fiji exemplify a good possibility of local fish catch monitoring on small islands. However, data processing for scientifically and locally useful outcomes remains a fragile effort, and some management actions may have to remain precautionary rather than based on scientific data or local knowledge.

939,Philippine coral reefs under threat: Lessons learned after 25 years of community-based reef conservation,"The Philippine archipelago consists of more than 7000 islands. Most of these islands have extensive coral reefs or coral communities. For centuries, reefs and their associated resources have provided the livelihood for a large portion of the coastal population. However, reefs as sources of income are threatened by over-exploitation and by the use of destructive fishing methods. The scientific community, natural resource managers and many of the small-scale fishermen are aware that catches are falling rapidly while the fast growing population requires increasing amounts of fish. Since the early 1970s, various programs have tried to counter the decline of Philippine coastal resources. This article reports about successful examples of reef conservation in the provinces of Negros Oriental, Batangas and the Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park, Palawan. In all three localities, significant areas of reefs are legally protected and sustainable management regimes are working effectively. In Negros and Batangas this success is partly a result of intensive education programs that contributed to the active involvement of the traditional fishermen and the larger coastal community. Community participation and co-operation of all institutions involved in resource management are regarded as the key elements of sustainable reef management in these areas. This paper presents the objectives, programs and achievements as well as the fruitful networking of the participating organizations. Particular emphasis is placed on the experiences and lessons emanating from 25 years of reef conservation while showing the overall objective of sustainable use is still far on the horizon. It is suggested that more integrated forms of management, involving various stakeholders, and that address the numerous intertwined issues, will save Philippine reefs.

940,"Evaluating participative capacity-building in environmental policy: Provincial fish protection and parks management in British Columbia, Canada","For provincial fish protection and parks policy in British Columbia, the provincial government has recently experimented with the devolution of environmental management design through a range of participatory instruments. This paper examines this 'participative capacity-building' according to key criteria adopted by the provincial environmental bureaucracy. The corporate rationale for the use of participatory policy instruments is outlined, uncovering the shared causal assumptions of public agency officials about the linkages of these tools to general goals of procedural fairness and ecological competence. While the formative stage of the two environmental decision areas precludes any evaluation related to substantive policy outcomes, comparative findings on the appropriateness of the capacity-building are offered on the basis of internal staff appraisals and the views of key stakeholders. For parks management, the 1997-99 Park Legacy consultation process successfully adopted a variety of community-based participatory tools to discover shared values and interests on management issues. The process is widely acknowledged as having been inclusive, and its policy recommendations have reaffirmed the ecological role of provincial parks as well as endorsing the institutionalization of stakeholder participation in parks management. In the case of provincial fish protection, bureaucratic and political power-trading led to fragmented and skewed participative capacity-building. Negotiations on the critical regulatory area of streamside protection exposed key jurisdictional tensions between the federal, provincial and municipal governments.

941,Developing MPA Effectiveness Indicators: Comparison Within and Across Stakeholder Groups and Communities,"Shared expectations about marine protected areas (MPAs) might be expected to enhance their effectiveness. This study determined whether members of local communities had common or divergent views about the objectives and indicators of MPA effectiveness. In the central Philippines we used unconstrained and constrained methods to interview people in five stakeholder groups (elders, fishers, leaders, women, and youth) associated with each of 10 community-based no-take MPAs that had been protected between 0 and 21 years. Respondents identified multiple MPA objectives, the most frequently mentioned of which was restoring and sustaining fish populations. The results suggest that MPA age accounts for the greatest level of variation across communities. When unconstrained, progress in enforcement was identified as a key indicator among respondents from younger MPAs while respondents from older MPAs identified increased fish abundance and catch. Although consensus can be reached more easily under constrained conditions, the results derived from unconstrained methods are more revealing of the needs and aspirations of communities. These are likely to contribute more to the search for appropriate management interventions, particularly given that MPAs evolve over time. Hence, the development of MPA effectiveness indicators must be an iterative community-informed process to ensure timely and relevant management interventions.

Community organization and education were the main methods use to stimulate community activity at these sites. The project showed that it is possible to organize communities to manage their own coral reef resources. The presence of the marine reserve/sanctuaries led to measurable changes in reef quality within a period of only one year.

943,"Vulnerability and disaster in Thailand: Scale, power, and collaboration in post-tsunami recovery","This chapter examines the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami's impacts on coastal regions of Thailand with a focus recovery dynamics and the role of community-based organizations. With more than 8,000 killed and thousands homeless in Thailand, coupled with heavy impacts to fishing villages and large-scale loss of livelihoods, recovery challenges have been extensive. Patterns of uneven geographic development among a culturally and socially diverse population produced different recovery dynamics by location across the impact zone. Based on extensive fieldwork in the region by the lead author, we examine recovery dynamics in a representative coastal village. We begin by reviewing the historical geography of the area and how development patterns shaped local vulnerabilities prior to the tsunami. This provides context for analyzing impacts and response and recovery dynamics at the research site, with a focus on the diverse ways local leaders, displaced residents, government agencies, and NGOs promoted a variety of recovery strategies. We consider how relief organizations dealt with a culturally diverse population with substantial pre-disaster vulnerabilities, including the limitations of state-centered top-down approaches to recovery. Alternative approaches based on local leadership and collaborative networks across geographic scales proved more successful at coupling vulnerability reduction with local programs of recovery. We conclude with a discussion of the role of participatory approaches and local institution building in vulnerability reduction and capacity building in the region.

The development of the on-line hatchery monitoring and feeding management system for Nile Tilapia using an Android-driven automated feeder device that has a short messaging service (SMS) feature that notifies the administrator and farmworker of the auto feeder status was the key objective of this study. The Waterfall model - a software development life cycle approach was used in the development of the on-line monitoring and feeding management system. To determine the capability of the system to monitor the hatchery online, release the feed as scheduled and notify the user of the auto feeder status, the researcher utilized a survey questionnaire with 30 respondents from EVSU-CC employees and hatchery on-thejob trainees. The results were treated using Likert-scale and T-test (one-sampled statistics). The result showed that the system can successfully monitor the hatchery online, dispense feed as scheduled and notify the user of the auto feeder status through SMS.

945,"Community-based management of the USAT Liberty, Bali, Indonesia: Pathways to sustainable cultural heritage tourism","Purpose: This study presents an example of sustainable cultural heritage tourism. The heritage tourism at the site of the ship USAT Liberty in the small fishing village of Tulamben on the northeast coast of Bali Island plays a significant role in the lives of the local people who live nearby, who actively participate in the site's management. Design/methodology/approach: This study assessed the management of the site by the local community by means of formal interviews with major stakeholders, informal conversations, and observations in the field. Findings: Although it lacks any direct historical connection with the local community, the reuse of the shipwreck as a tourist asset has motivated the community to participate in the conservation of the site and sustain its values. This article argues that the case of the USAT Liberty demonstrates that the management of heritage sites can be effectively sustained using bottom-up approaches.

This study identifies and describes the roles of community, government, and other actors in management of small-scale fisheries in the Comoros (Western Indian Ocean). Actor roles in management as well as social perceptions and ecological indicators of management performance were investigated through stakeholder interviews and ecological surveys at 20 sites, including sites within and outside a Marine Protected Area. The weak boundaries and memberships observed in the fisheries coincided with an open access situation at a few sites, but the majority of sites maintained fisher buy-in and effective management through community engagement, horizontal networks of multi-community partnerships, and state support. This study also found that third party actors such as non-governmental organizations initiated effective management by providing environmental education, building capacity, and facilitating communication among stakeholders and community members.

947,Spatial multi-criteria analysis to capture socio-economic factors in mangrove conservation,"Mangrove forests are among the most productive ecosystems, located in tropical and subtropical coastal waters and river estuaries. Mangroves benefit both people and the environment by providing shelter for brackish-water organisms, such as fish and shrimp. They form a green-belt area that protects land from abrasion and tsunamis, along with goods and services for people, e.g., fruit, fish and charcoal. However, unmanaged use of mangrove ecosystems has resulted in a widespread decline in their function and conflicts between users. A paucity of research on mangrove management and spatial zoning is also contributing to the decline of these ecosystems. This study develops a prioritisation process with Spatial Multi-criteria Analysis (SMCA) for social-ecological mangrove management, based on a case study in Baros, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We include social (participation and perception), demographic, economic (economic value of mangroves) and ecological criteria (water quality, mangrove density and diversity, phytoplankton diversity and density) criteria and spatial considerations informed by remote sensing imagery. We consider the three different conservation scenarios of habitat protection areas, sanctuary areas, and restricted areas to help configure management plan options. We demonstrate how SMCA can support managers and policymakers in mapping conservation areas based on complex and diverse social-ecological data. However, further discussion with stakeholders in Baros is required to validate the produced map for future use. The involvement of stakeholders and governing bodies from the beginning or within the SMCA analysis will always be crucial in community-based prioritisations.

This has lead to formulation of various policies to maintain environmental quality and sustainably manage the coastal resources. Basically, the coastal zone needs to address the demands of all the stakeholders starting from traditional local communities, administrators, to academic researchers etc. India has faced tremendous challenges in implementing regulatory measures like Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) issued in 1991 by demarcating countries coast in to four different zones with provisions and prohibitions for various activities. The concept of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been taken with the support of spatial decision-support tools derived from satellite data including national programmes on inter-sectoral approaches towards ICZM. 2004 onwards a series of disasters have reminded the necessity of having regulatory measures through implementable approaches. Subsequently, the CRZ 2011 notification has been a new addition to the list of policies using bottom-up approach as a good governance tool. The country has strengthened its potential in coastal management, disaster management and several community based field projects to enhance participation of stakeholders.

Small-scale fisheries are receiving more attention and communities are increasingly resisting a resourcist perspective that treats fish as a commodity by engaging in efforts to (re)envision fisheries as part of food systems. This paper presents four case studies from freshwater and marine fisheries across Canada to demonstrate ways of using food systems as an organizing concept to protect small-scale fisheries, build sustainable communities, and influence fisheries governance and policy. Insights are shared from the lobster fishery in Shelburne County, Nova Scotia; fish and country foods harvesting in Kakisa, Northwest Territories; traditional fisheries of Batchewana First Nation on Lake Superior, Ontario; and the national sustainable seafood partnership program, SeaChoice. We conclude by providing our collective ideas for how governance and policy may better support sustainability at the nexus of fisheries and food systems, emphasizing a need for structures and policies that are better adapted to the contexts of small-scale fisheries and that empower community participation in decision-making.

952,Lack of cross-scale linkages reduces robustness of community-based fisheries management,"Community-based management and the establishment of marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as means to overcome overexploitation of fisheries. Yet, researchers and managers are divided regarding the effectiveness of these measures. The ""tragedy of the commons"" model is often accepted as a universal paradigm, which assumes that unless managed by the State or privatized, common-pool resources are inevitably overexploited due to conflicts between the self-interest of individuals and the goals of a group as a whole. Under this paradigm, the emergence and maintenance of effective community-based efforts that include cooperative risky decisions as the establishment of marine reserves could not occur. In this paper, we question these assumptions and show that outcomes of commons dilemmas can be complex and scale-dependent. We studied the evolution and effectiveness of a community-based management effort to establish, monitor, and enforce a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Our findings build on social and ecological research before (1997-2001), during (2002) and after (2003-2004) the establishment of marine reserves, which included participant observation in >100 fishing trips and meetings, interviews, as well as fishery dependent and independent monitoring. We found that locally crafted and enforced harvesting rules led to a rapid increase in resource abundance. Nevertheless, news about this increase spread quickly at a regional scale, resulting in poaching from outsiders and a subsequent rapid cascading effect on fishing resources and locally-designed rule compliance. We show that cooperation for management of common-pool fisheries, in which marine reserves form a core component of the system, can emerge, evolve rapidly, and be effective at a local scale even in recently organized fisheries. Stakeholder participation in monitoring, where there is a rapid feedback of the systems response, can play a key role in reinforcing cooperation. However, without cross-scale linkages with higher levels of governance, increase of local fishery stocks may attract outsiders who, if not restricted, will overharvest and threaten local governance. Fishers and fishing communities require incentives to maintain their management efforts. Rewarding local effective management with formal cross-scale governance recognition and support can generate these incentives.

953,"Prevalence and associated factors of goiter among rural children aged 6-12 years old in Northwest Ethiopia, cross -sectional study","Background: Goiter, an indicator of chronic iodine deficiency, is a major public health problem for populations living with iodine deficient environment, particularly for young children. It is a threat to the social and economic development of many developing countries including Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of goiter among rural children aged 6-12 years, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods. A community based cross-sectional study was employed from July to December 2012 in Lay Armachiho district. A total of 698 children aged 6-12 years were included in the study. Multistage sampling was used. Children were examined for the presence/absence of goiter using a criterion set by World Health Organization. The level of Iodine of the salt was estimated by using spot testing kits. Descriptive and summary statistics were employed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated factors. The degree of association was assessed by using Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were computed to see the presence and strength of association. Results: Totally 694 children were included in the analysis. The prevalence of goiter was found to be 37.6%. Goiter of grade 1 was 28.5% and that of grade 2 was 9.1%. 29.7% of the samples had adequate iodine content. The age of child (AOR: 1.24,95% CI: 1.12, 1.36), being female (AOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.38-2.85), salt iodine level (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.71), family history of goiter (AOR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.08, 4.858), fish consumption (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI; 0.22, 0.80) were factors associated with goiter. Conclusion: Chronic iodine deficiency was a severe public health problem in the study communities. Ensuring the consumption of iodized salt and promotion of fish intake at the household level are highly recommended.

954,The role of perceptions for community-based marine resource management,"Every community-based marine resource management (CBMRM) inherently takes place in a highly complex social-ecological environment, and stakeholder perceptions related to various aspects of the natural and social environment guide behavior in every stage of the management process. This paper provides an introduction to the psychology of perception with regard to marine resource management. In particular, it offers a typology of CBMRM relevant perceptions along with an analysis of psychological, societal, and physical factors that modulate them. Based on this analysis, we propose the introduction of specially trained local Perception Experts (PE's), whose role will be to recognize and reflect individual perceptions of involved stakeholders, and to communicate them at community meetings where decisions are made. This empirically testable addition to current CBMRM schemes could help to increase participation, develop management measures that fit the capacities of the involved stakeholders more accurately, and hence, contribute to a faster rehabilitation of marine resources.

955,Biodiversity monitoring at the tonle sap lake of cambodia: A comparative assessment of local methods,"This paper assesses local biodiversity monitoring methods practiced in the Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia. For the assessment we used the following criteria: methodological rigor, perceived cost, ease of use (user friendliness), compatibility with existing activities, and effectiveness of intervention. Constraints and opportunities for execution of the methods were also considered. Information was collected by use of: (1) key informant interview, (2) focus group discussion, and (3) researcher's observation. The monitoring methods for fish, birds, reptiles, mammals and vegetation practiced in the research area have their unique characteristics of generating data on biodiversity and biological resources. Most of the methods, however, serve the purpose of monitoring biological resources rather than biodiversity. There is potential that the information gained through local monitoring methods can provide input for long-term management and strategic planning. In order to realize this potential, the local monitoring methods should be better integrated with each other, adjusted to existing norms and regulations, and institutionalized within community-based organization structures.

956,,"Analysis of small-scale inland fisheries (SSIFs) is often highly dispersed and tends not reflect the true magnitude of their contribution to society. This is partly due to the insufficient attention given to this sector by the relevant authorities, in addition to its highly diverse characteristics, with complex patterns of operation in a wide range of systems, often in remote areas. Here, by integrating fishers as participatory fishery monitors, we provide fishery-dependent estimates of yields, the biological attributes of the fish species, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fisheries of lakes on the floodplain of the SÃƒÂ£o Francisco basin in northeastern Brazil. As the fishers were willing participates in the monitoring, the results revealed well-structured artisanal fishing activities, with the lake system providing high-profile fish harvests from both monthly and annual perspectives. The spatial distribution of fishing effort reflected the adaptation of the fishers to the flood cycle of the river, in order to maintain high fishery productivity throughout the year. The results also indicate that participatory monitoring can help to overcome knowledge gaps and provide a database that is readily applicable to management needs at both local and regional scales. As Brazil is one few worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nations that no longer have national fishing monitoring program, participatory monitoring represents a low-cost solution for the credible and useful data on small-scale fisheries. It would thus appear to be extremely worthwhile to invest in the empowerment of communities in order to overcome the historic vulnerability of productive sector and the food security of the populations that depend on these fisheries.

957,Opportunities and impediments for use of local data in the management of salmon fisheries,"Data availability challenges the management of small-scale fisheries in large river basins. One way to circumvent the challenges of data collection is to rely on local stakeholders who are well-positioned to collect data that can inform management through community-based monitoring (CBM). Although science and management has increasingly considered opportunities for community involvement in scientific research, the efficacy of these programs are rarely assessed. We describe a current CBM initiative in the Kuskokwim River Basin of western Alaska. We then explore how existing approaches for incorporating local involvement in fisheries research and management measure against claims made by CBM programs to understand pathways for data utility for decision makers and approaches to capacity building and meaningful engagement of local citizens. We identify major gaps in the CBM literature and explore one of these gaps through an interview-based study of public participation in the Kuskokwim. We find that the CBM program intent to collect high quality data was complemented by increasing trust in data stewards. Ultimately, through our interview findings we illustrate how definitions of local engagement differ, how CBM data is used by decision makers, and how trust in data is dependent on trust in data stewards and the infrastructure that supports that stewardship.

958,"Stakeholder participation in research design and decisions: Scientists, fishers, and mercury in saltwater fish","Individuals who fish and eat self-caught fish make decisions about where to fish, the type to eat, and the quantity to eat. Federal and state agencies often issue consumption advisories for some fish with high mercury (Hg) concentrations, but seldom provide either the actual metal levels to the general public, or identify the fish that have low contaminant levels. Community participatory research is of growing importance in defining, studying, and resolving complex exposure and risk issues, and this paper is at the intersection of traditional stakeholder approaches and community-based participatory research. The objective of this paper is to describe the process whereby stakeholders (fishers), were involved in directing and refining research questions to address their particular informational needs about mercury levels in fish, potential risks, and methods to maintain health, by balancing the risks and benefits of fish consumption. A range of stakeholders, mainly individual fishers, fishing organizations, and other scientists, were involved at nearly every stage. Community participants influenced many aspects of the design and implementation of the research, in the determination of which fish species to sample, in the collection of the samples, and in the final analyses and synthesis, as well as the communication of results and implications of the research through their fishing club publications, talks and gatherings. By involving the most interested and affected communities, the data and conclusions are relevant to their needs because the fish examined were those they ate and wanted information about, and directly address concerns about the risk from consuming self-caught fish. Although mercury levels in fish presumed to be high in mercury are known, little information was available to the fishermen on mercury levels in fish that were low and thus provided little risk to their families. While community participatory research is more time-consuming and expensive than traditional scientific research, both the process and results are better scientifically in terms of community relevance.

959,Social-ecological resilience and community-based tourism in the commonwealth of Dominica,"Coastal zones and tropical islands are some of the most popular tourism destinations worldwide, and recent scholarship has explored the linkages between community-based tourism development and social-ecological resilience. Social-ecological resilience is the capacity of a social-ecological system to adapt to change from shocks or surprises, which also applies to the context of community-based tourism development. Data were collected on the island of the Commonwealth of Dominica. In the six coastal communities of Roseau, Portsmouth, Mero, Soufriere, Layou, and Scotts Head, resident perceptions of social-ecological resilience were examined through 40 semi-structured interviews using snowball sampling with community members who were self-employed in either the farming, fishing, or tourism industries, community leaders, or those who were involved in tourism-related efforts or policy at a mid- to senior-level. Interview transcripts were coded inductively for salient themes. Results indicate that community member access to the benefits of tourism are enabled by factors such as the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tourism reputation and its interconnected primary industries (farming, fishing, and tourism). These emergent themes that hinder local residentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ access to benefits from tourism, such as limited physical access to and within the island and grant dependency, have the potential to threaten resilience. Limited access influenced seasonal tourism, related income dynamics, and contributed to grant dependency and income diversification. Income was not viewed as a social-cultural cue. Understanding what does and does not support access to the benefits of tourism can help evaluate measures of social-ecological resilience for a tourism destination community. Evaluating measures of social-ecological resilience can help evaluate the success of related development policies and provide focus for future ones. Coastal areas with high measures of social-cultural resilience are less vulnerable and more able to adapt or transform to shocks or disturbances.

960,"Small-scale fisheries of coral reefs and the need for community-based resource management in Malalison Island, Philippines","Fish landings in Malalison Island in the west central Philippines were monitored from February 1991 to January 1992 to determine the types of fishing gear employed, the predominant species caught, the catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the yield from the coral reefs. Fishing was monitored only during the spring tide periods, after a preliminary sampling showed no significant differences among four lunar phases. A total of 494 fishing operations was recorded. CPUE (kg per fisher h-1) by gear was 1.1 for spear guns, 1.4 for spear guns with compressor, 0.4 for set gill nets, 2.4 for drive-in gill nets, 1.2 for drift gill nets, and 0.7 for hook-and-lines. The CPUEs of Malalison gears are similar to those of other coral reef fisheries. Dominant species caught were fusiliers and surgeonfishes by gill net. surgeonfishes by spear gun, and snappers and groupers by hook-and-line. The fish yield from the Malalison coral reefs was estimated to be 5.8 t km-2 year-1, which is low, and similar to overexploited reefs in the Philippines and elsewhere. Live coral cover averages 35% in Malalison. Reef degradation, high fishing effort, low yields, and the poverty of the fishing community suggest 'Malthusian overfishing'.

961,"The community-based management of coastal fisheries in Himeshima, Oita Prefectura, Japan: A case study of the fishing ground regulations on the offshore fixed gill net fishery","In recent arguments about fisheries management, the community-based approach has attracted more attention. The aim of this paper is to investigate the content and meanings of the fisheries management carried out by a coastal community with various fisheries, and moreover to examine the dynamic aspects of the management, considering changes in the environment and changes in its use. The study area is Himeshima, Oita Prefecture, an island whose economy has been highly dependent on small-scale coastal fisheries. The fishermen there have constituted the 'Gyogyo-kisetsu', a written code of fishing activities, under a fisheries cooperative association. The case studied in this paper is the fishing ground regulations, that is to say, the spatial restrictions of fishing ground use on the offshore fixed gill net fishery in the Gyogyo-kisetsu. The fishery became popular in the late 1960s and detailed fishing ground regulations have been applied to it as the fixed nets occupy the sea widely. Examination of the contents of these regulations reveals that they have been constituted and carried out mainly for adjustment between the gill net fishery and other fisheries. The operations of 'weaker' fisheries or conventional fisheries, such as the angling fishery, the longline fishery and the surrounding seine fishery, on important fishing grounds, have been protected by the adjustment. In introducing the modern gill net fishery, it was crucial for the community to develop regulations to enable the coexistence of old and new fisheries and to avoid conflicts. In addition, such adjustment has been sometimes related to the conservation of fishery resources and important fishing grounds. On the other hand, the environment and the use of the fishing grounds where the gill net fishery is regulated have not remained static but have sometimes undergone big changes up to the present day. Distinct examples are the sharp decrease in sand lance and the decline of some conventional fisheries, influencing the state of fishing ground use. Despite these changes, each fishing ground regulation on the gill net fishery has been kept in the Gyogyo-kisetsu up to the present day since it was established, even though its actual function or meanings can be somewhat flexible and variable. These facts show that the regulations have been maintained and carried out in an imbalanced relationship with the fishing ground environment or the fishing ground use affected by fluctuations. Examination of such dynamic aspects of the regulations indicates some vaguenees or ambiguity inherent in the management carried out in the relationship with an uncertain environment.",NA,No,"The case study in the paper is from Japan, not from any of the countries specified in the SC."," No; The paper is a case study from Himeshima, Oita Prefecture, Japan, not from any of the listed countries.

The socioeconomic theory of resource management compliance is reviewed and applied to community-based case examples from North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Compliance with nondestructive exploitation practices in several village sites, empirically measured by changes in live hard coral cover, was related to reef distance from a settlement area and not significantly related to visibility from a settlement.

964,Factors influencing community fishers' leadership engagement in international small-scale fisheries,"Local leadership is crucial to the functioning of local organizations in small-scale fishing (SSF) communities. By analyzing local leadership experiences of 54 international SSF researchers and practitioners, we aim in this paper to fill knowledge gaps that recent research has identified regarding our understanding of factors that influence the effectiveness of local leadership. Influencing factors are organized using modified versions of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory, and Schwartz's theory of cultural values. We identified factors that help shape leadership engagement and effectiveness at multiple levels, including: precursors to individual action that relate to potential SSF leaders' perceptions of threats and opportunities; institutional constraints at the individual level and community level; and high level governance issues. Precursors to individual action were numerous and multi-faceted, and individual behaviors were shaped by core values and attitudes, culture, experiences, and education. Motivation to participate in leadership can either be altruistic in nature or oriented toward self-enhancement. A lack of motivation for leadership could be attributed to the individualistic nature of many fishers. The availability of capital assets can facilitate or hinder participation in leadership. Individuals who may be willing to take on leadership roles were often hindered by lack of money and time, low educational attainment, or poor social cohesion among community members. The interactions between leaders and followers were crucial for effective leadership, especially a leader's perceived legitimacy and the ability of a community to groom appropriate successors. At the higher level, constant policy change and the resulting uncertainty were linked to decreasing motivation and apathy regarding SSF management at the local level, and disintegrating relationships between government level and local level actors. Our research highlights how local leadership and context are linked, and suggests potential researchable hypotheses that would in the future help further advance empirical and theoretical understanding of leadership influences in SSFs.

966,Marine conservation in remote small island settings: Factors influencing marine protected area establishment in the Azores,"This paper examines the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) in remote small island settings with specific reference to the Portuguese island of Corvo in the Azores. This case study represents different approaches to marine conservation, ranging from an informal community-based no-take MPA to a government-driven multi-purpose natural park, involving diverse local and external actors interacting over an extended period of time. In-depth interviews were used to explore the perceptions of local and expert stakeholders about positive and negative aspects of MPA establishment. This demonstrated how differing approaches have led to varying degrees of MPA effectiveness. From the community-based MPA, several key ingredients for effective MPA establishment were identified, including engaging and empowering local communities, clear definition of goals, visible MPA outputs and community enforcement based on high levels of support and peer group pressure. However, in a context of complex marine resource use, the limitations of community-based initiatives prevent them from achieving broad ecosystem conservation goals. These might be better achieved through government-driven MPAs, provided that they are integrated in a wider regional marine strategy and that there is political will to effectively implement conservation measures and to allocate resources for management, enforcement and monitoring.

In this context, an analysis of Khuzestan inshore fisheries data covering the years 2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011, was conducted in reliance on testing for occurrence of the fishing down marine food webs (FDMFW) phenomenon in the North of Persian Gulf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). In this study, the mean trophic level (mTL) and the fishing-in-balance (FIB)-index of Khuzestan landings during this period of time were estimated using the trophic level of 47 fishery resources. Increase in total landings (Y) was observed, which explained the high fishing yield in major fishery resources (especially demersal). Moreover, the moderates decreasing trend in mTL per decade, and the increasing trend in FIB-index were observed. The status of fishery resources in Khuzestan inshore waters (under exploited but not overexploited), the rise in Y, FIB and slightly drop in mTL can be considered as indirect indicators of the fishing impacts on the trophic structure of marine communities. Based on this result, probability occurrence of FDMFW process in Khuzestan inshore waters is low to some extent. However, we suggest that the goal of management programs in Khuzestan inshore waters should prevent the continuance of this trend in the long-term using an ecosystem-based approach.

968,"Care, not incarceration: exploring the carcerality of fisheries enforcement and potential decolonial futures in HawaiÃŠÂ»i","Current U.S. environmental management paradigms default to enforcement mechanisms that feed into the prison industrial complex, such as fines and jailing. To avoid contributing to and reinforcing mass incarceration and militarism, environmental management systems need to be transformed towards non-carceral forms. Additionally, working towards Indigenous sovereignty and decolonization, requires the strengthening of Indigenous relations with and governance over the land under the respective paradigms of Indigenous communities. This paper uses HawaiÃŠÂ»i state fisheries law and programmatic efforts to address a central question: What is the extent and nature of carceral norms within conventional environmental management systems and how do they affect management outcomes? The study examines the current fisheries enforcement scheme in HawaiÃŠÂ»i, tracing the embedded logic of carcerality, the degree to which ultimate sources of harm are addressed, and the concentration of governing powers. The results highlight how current fisheries enforcement is insufficient in caring for the seascape and, through its carceral approach, contributes to social injustices, particularly for KÃ„Ânaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians). Additionally, this paper demonstrates how current efforts in HawaiÃŠÂ»i Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Community-Based Subsistence Fisheries Areas (CBSFAs), the ÃŠÂ»Aha Moku system, and the Makai Watch Program Ã¢â‚¬â€œ attempt to empower communities, but ultimately keep enforcement powers centralized within the State, thus perpetuating dependency on the criminal justice system.

969,The role of strong-tie social networks in mediating food security of fish resources by a traditional riverine community in the Brazilian Amazon,"Social networks are a significant way through which rural communities that manage resources under common property regimes obtain food resources. Previous research on food security and social network analysis has mostly focused on egocentric network data or proxy variables for social networks to explain how social relations contribute to the different dimensions of food security. Whole-network approaches have the potential to contribute to former studies by revealing how individual social ties aggregate into complex structures that create opportunities or constraints to the sharing and distribution of food resources. We used a whole-network approach to investigate the role of network structure in contributing to the four dimensions of food security: food availability, access, utilization, and stability. For a case study of a riparian community from the Brazilian Amazon that is dependent on fish as a key element of food security, we mapped the community strong-tie network among 97% of the village population over 14 years old (n = 336) by integrating reciprocated friendship and occupational ties, as well as close kinship relationships. We explored how different structural properties of the community network contribute to the understanding of (1) the availability of fish as a community resource, (2) community access to fish as a dietary resource, (3) the utilization of fish for consumption in a way that allows the villagers to maximize nutrition while at the same time minimizing toxic risks associated with mercury exposure, and (4) the stability of the fish resources in local ecosystems as a result of cooperative behaviors and community-based management.

However, nowadays, seaports are among the fastest growing industries, which in turn lead to a variety of coastal resource use conflicts and provoke strong resistance in communities adjacent to seaports. Currently, it becomes an increasingly important aspect of limitations and constraints for future seaport businesses growth. In order to reduce environmental impact, seaport companies are implementing eco-innovations to remedy the conflicts among seaport businesses and local communities. The present study is aimed at the development of a conceptual conflict management model regarding conflict prevention between seaport businesses and the society. The research was performed at three separate levels: technological process level, company level and across all businesses involved in the marine industry. The paper summarises knowledge gained during the research on reducing environmental impact using eco-innovations. The paper provides an analysis of the main causes of environmental conflicts in KlaipÃƒÂ©da seaport and, by providing the analysis of environmental measures according to the proposed conflict management model, contributes to conflict prevention and remediation by involvement of eco-innovations.

971,Multiscale relationships between Great Lakes nearshore fish communities and anthropogenic shoreline factors,"The multi-scale nature of streams, rivers, and inland lakes is well documented, although relationships between the ecology of Great Lakes nearshore areas and shoreline processes are generally poorly described. Given the high levels of development pressure currently exerted on Great Lakes shorelines, we sought to determine whether patterns exist between measures of shoreline development quantified at multiple spatial scales and adjacent fish community measures. We expected that fish measures for nearshore areas immediately adjacent to intact versus modified shorelines would differ as a result of the greater buffering capacity of the intact shorelines. Further, we expected anthropogenic shoreline factors to act cumulatively in combination with prevailing currents to influence fish communities in downdrift nearshore areas. Our results indicated that a few shallow water and nearshore fish community measures exhibited significant patterns that may be attributable to immediately adjacent shoreline characteristics. In addition, several fish measures were related to urban-residential land uses and shore structure numbers of updrift shoreline areas, suggesting that cumulative anthropogenic factors operating over larger spatial scales also influence local fish communities. Based on these results, we argue that there is critical need for multi-scale management strategies for shorelines that address the potential for both local and cumulative, larger-scale environmental impacts relative to local nearshore biota.

972,Linking livelihoods to improved biodiversity conservation through sustainable integrated coastal management and community based dive tourism : Oslob Whale Sharks,"Alternative livelihood projects are criticised as having minimal effect on biodiversity conservation. Studies are rare and where success is claimed, outcomes and reasons why projects work, have not been documented. Livelihoods are an essential element of sustainable integrated coastal management, an accepted framework for conserving coral reefs and marine resources in the tropics. It is not known whether alternative livelihood projects contribute to the goal of improving biodiversity conservation through sustainable integrated coastal management. Here, we examine Oslob Whale Sharks, an alternate livelihoods project in the Philippines built on provisioning whale sharks for community based dive tourism. We investigate how Oslob Whale Sharks contributes to sustainable integrated coastal management and whether it has any effect on biodiversity conservation. Using key stakeholder interviews with artisanal fishers, their community, local politicians and government, we found that Oslob Whale Sharks contributes to all nine factors required for sustainable integrated coastal management. Fishers and local authorities report their perception that whale sharks are protected from poaching and finning and destructive fishing has decreased, while fish abundance, pelagic fish species and catch have increased. Our findings further suggest that as there is little evidence that this type of tourism has any negative impacts on the biology or behaviour of whale sharks, Oslob Whale Sharks provides sustainable livelihoods and a delivery mechanism for sustainable integrated coastal management.

973,Strengthening post-hoc analysis of community-based fisheries management through the social-ecological systems framework,"Community-based fisheries management (CBFM) is held up as one of the most promising approaches for securing sustainable small-scale fisheries. Yet, the complex features that shape CBFM outcomes remain inadequately understood. In part, this stems from the fact that few community-based projects meet the data requirements for formal impact evaluations. Given this context, diagnostic approaches are increasingly seen as a frontier for strengthening CBFM analysis and securing small-scale fisheries sustainability. This study explores the capacity of Elinor Ostrom's social-ecological systems (SES) framework to strengthen post-hoc diagnosis of CBFM. It draws on data from published and grey literature (including field notes, meeting minutes, and project reports) generated throughout an eight-year CBFM project in five Solomon Island villages. Results suggest that successful CBFM outcomes were facilitated by effective information sharing, harvesting rules that merge traditional and contemporary practices, strong leadership, and resource monitoring, while uneven power differentials undermined positive outcomes. The paper argues that the SES framework can add analytical rigour to post-hoc analysis when it used to: 1) engage with temporal dynamics that shape CBFM processes; 2) integrate insights from plural theories, and 3) explore interactions between multiple CBFM outcomes. Ultimately, the paper argues that diagnostic applications of the SES framework can contribute towards conducting more systematic analysis of diverse CBFM data, improving CBRM practices, and realizing more sustainable small-scale fisheries Ã‚Â© 2017",NA,Yes,"The paper includes a case study from the Solomon Islands, which is one of the countries of interest according to the SC."," Yes; The abstract mentions a case study conducted in five Solomon Island villages.

975,A 'Farmer /Fisherperson and Allied Community Medical' - a quality-improvement template of care in primary care,"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Ireland is an island known for its welcome, its warm people, green fields and beautiful coastline. A sizable proportion of the Irish population work in the farming, forestry and fishing industries, particularly in rural and coastal regions1. The broad farming and fisher people cohort have specific health and primary care needs2,3 and, as a result, I devised a template of care provision in primary care, to help guide the primary care team privileged to look after this unique group of people4. AIMS: To devise a template of proposed quality care or care considerations for members of the farming and fisher people community, which can be used in general practice, as part of the practice software system.To improve and ease delivery of high-quality primary care to the farming and fisher people in the community. METHODS: Personal reflection on my professional experience as a General Practitioner in rural and coastal communities from South West GP (General Practitioner) Training Scheme training to the current time, a lifetime of living in a rural location not too far from the sea, and the lessons I have learnt from the people of home, my local community, and the people I serve.Conversation with and feedback from a wise, retired farmer with thanks.Literature Review of the health concerns and needs of farmers and fisher people. RESULTS: Creation of a farmer/fisherperson medical quality-improvement template of care to support primary care delivery to these communities. DISCUSSION: A template of care provision for primary care to utilise if wished in caring for members of the fishing and farming communities to improve quality of care delivered, and which is accessible, user-friendly, and comprehensive.Plan to hopefully trial this template in primary care going forward, and audit the primary healthcare quality received by farmers and members of the fishing community, based on the parameters included in this quality improvement template.References1 Factsheet on Agriculture in Ireland 2016. https://igees.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/June-2016-Factsheet-Final.pdf [Retrieved 28 September 2022]2 Smyth B, Evans DS, Kelly A, Cullen L, O'Donovan D.

976,A method to assess the sensitivity of sedimentary communities to fishing activities,"Methods of sensitivity assessment to identify species and habitats in need of management or protection have been available since the 1970s. The approach to sensitivity assessment adopted by the Marine Life Information Network (MarLIN) assumes that the sensitivity of a community or biotope is dependent on the species within it. However, the application of this approach to sedimentary communities, especially offshore, is complex because of a lack of knowledge of the structural or functional role of many sedimentary species. This paper describes a method to assess the overall sensitivity of sedimentary communities, based on the intolerance and recoverability of component species to physical disturbance. A range of methods were applied to identify the best combinations of abundant, dominant or high biomass species for the assessment of sensitivity in the sedimentary communities examined. Results showed that reporting the most frequent species' sensitivity assessment, irrespective of the four methods used to select species, consistently underestimated the total sensitivity of the community. In contrast, reporting the most sensitive assessment from those species selected resulted in a range of biotope sensitivities from very low to very high, that was better able to discriminate between the sensitivities of the communities examined. The assumptions behind the methodology, its limitations and potential application are discussed. Ã‚Â© Crown copyright 2008. Reproduced with permission of Her majesty's stationery office.

977,Legal approaches to MPA governance in Indo-Pacific small island states: A focus on public participation,"The Indo-Pacific small island states characteristically have relatively small land areas but large maritime zones that include biodiversity hotspots, fragile ecosystems and unique habitats affected by anthropogenic impacts and natural pressures. Whilst there are differences between these nations in terms of geography, history, and politico-legal systems, the majority are developing countries with limited technical and financial resources to implement laws for marine conservation and management. Despite these limitations all the small island states have laws for marine protected areas (MPAs)in one form or another. Because these countries also rely heavily on the coastal zone and marine resources in terms of subsistence and livelihoods for local communities, the extent to which the law accommodates civil society interests, and involvement in decision-making and management, is critical. Although some studies have explored law and policy relevant to MPAs in individual countries, rarely have countries across the Indo-Pacific region been compared. By doing so, different approaches and success stories can be shared, as well as legislative gaps and challenges addressed. This paper outlines the legal frameworks that provide for the establishment and management of MPAs in a selection of small island states across the Indo Pacific. The laws have been comparatively analysed to demonstrate the extent to which they provide for public participation and community-based management. The results are presented together with lessons learnt and recommendations made for future legal developments.

978,Economic and management benefits from the coordination of capture and culture fisheries: The case of prince william sound pink salmon,"Aquaculture developments often create policy conflicts with established fisheries when the two are not coordinated through a common planning framework. The state of Alaska and community-based, fisher-led salmon aquaculture associations have been unusually successful at coordinating, through cooperative management, the traditional salmon capture fisheries and new culture fisheries for pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, despite predictable problems. The Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation in particular has moved from its original involvement in resource enhancement into partnership with the state in harvest planning, allocation, and comprehensive regional planning. Some of the specific economic benefits and the general management benefits of this institutional arrangement are explored. One economic benefit was an 8-year period of price advantage for the association's cost-recovery fish because of large and consistent volume and quality.

979,Designing effective reserve networks for nonequilibrium metacommunities,"The proliferation of efficient fishing practices has promoted the depletion of commercial stocks around the world and caused significant collateral damage to marine habitats. Recent empirical studies have shown that marine reserves can play an important role in reversing these effects. Equilibrium metapopulation models predict that networks of marine reserves can provide similar benefits so long as individual reserves are sufficiently large to achieve self-sustainability, or spaced based on the extent of dispersal of the target species in order to maintain connectivity between neighboring reserves. However, these guidelines have not been tested in nonequilibrium metacommunity models that exhibit the kinds of complex spatiotemporal dynamics typically seen in natural marine communities. Here, we used a spatially explicit predator-prey model whose predictions have been validated in a marine system to show that current guidelines are not optimal for metacommunities. In equilibrium metacommunities, there is a community-level trade-off for designing effective reserves: Networks whose size and spacing are smaller than the extent of dispersal maximize global predator abundance but minimize global prey abundance because of trophic cascades, whereas the converse is true for reserve networks whose size and spacing are larger than the extent of dispersal. In nonequilibrium metacommunities, reserves whose size and spacing match the extent of spatial autocorrelation in adult abundance (i.e., the extent of patchiness) escape this community-level trade-off by maximizing global abundance and persistence of both the prey and the predator. Overall, these results suggest that using the extent of adult patchiness instead of the extent of larval dispersal as the size and spacing of reserve networks is critical for designing community-based management strategies. By emphasizing patchiness over dispersal distance, our results show how the apparent complexity of nonequilibrium communities can actually simplify management guidelines and reduce uncertainty associated with the assessment of dispersal in marine environments.

980,Poverty and livelihood impacts of community based fisheries management in Bangladesh,"We examine the impact of the Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) on welfare of fishing households in Bangladesh. Our analyses demonstrate how the various types of livelihood assets contribute to household income of fishers in different types of water body areas such as closed beels (deeper depressions in the floodplain), open beels (lake), floodplain beels and rivers. Data for the study were obtained from two questionnaire-based field surveys conducted by the Bangladesh CBFM project office: a baseline study carried out in 2002 and an impact study in mid-2006. A total of 1994 households were randomly selected from 34 (51%) CBFM project water bodies in Bangladesh. Our study shows that fisher's income has significantly increased in floodplain beels (FPB), open beels (OB), and rivers. Fishers' income from fishing has been significantly reduced in closed beels (CB) due to excessive lease fees and stocking costs for aquaculture. The regression results indicate that natural, physical, and financial assets have significantly contributed to income of the fisher households in open beels, rivers, and floodplain beels. The CBFM organized fishers have changed their attitudes, improved trust, and resolved conflicts in open beels. Results of the study suggest that natural, physical, and financial assets play very significant roles in poverty reduction in CBFM areas in Bangladesh. There is a need to give priority to investment in social capital and financial credit for reducing poverty of fishers of Bangladesh.

981,"Marine resource management and fisheries governance in Belize exhibit a polycentric, decentralized, and nested institutional structure","Overfishing is one of the most severe anthropogenic threats to the world's oceans, marked by widespread degradation of marine food webs and disruption of ecosystem functioning. Global fisheries can be categorized as common-pool resource (CPR) systems because restricting marine resource extraction is extremely challenging, and over-extraction contributes to an overall decline in availability to others. Because of these challenges, establishing effective institutions for the sustainable management of natural resource systems is essential. Community-based fisheries management offers a potential solution to overcome the challenges associated with fisheries as CPRs by including fishers in the management of their fisheries through collective action. The purpose of this study was to examine the institutional robustness (e.g. presence of nested and decentralized enterprises as indicators of resilience to shocks) of over 40 years of fisheries management in Belize. I used a mixed methods approach combining review of secondary literature, semi-structured interviews with key informants across the governmental, non-governmental, and fishers' sectors, and participant observation. The results of this study suggest that Belize has the institutions in place to overcome collective action problems and be a long-enduring CPR system.

982,"Certifying the commons: Eco-certification, privatization, and collective action","We examine new dynamics of privatization and collective action in common pool resource situations facilitated by the nonstate multistakeholder institutions of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the global leader in sustainability certification for wild caught seafood. Through a review of the literature and two case studies of fishing cooperatives in Baja California Sur, Mexico and on Fogo Island in the Canadian Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), we advance two interrelated arguments. First, certification and eco-labeling institutions privatize fisheries governance in largely unexamined ways through the injection of new forms of exclusive rights or privileges into common pool resource situations already complicated by access and property privileges, creating conditions for confusion and conflict as well as cooperation. Second, the MSC whole stock definition of sustainability places greater demands on certification clients for engaging in collective action by encouraging coordination over all social extractions from targeted fish stocks. Although rules encouraging collective action in common pool situations militate against the narrow private capture of certificate and eco-label rights, they also undermine the ability of small-scale and community-based fisheries that are embedded in larger unhealthy fishery contexts to acquire the right to the MSC stamp of sustainability. We conclude that MSC certification and ecolabeling create new institutions of private property rights and collective action, which can result in exclusionary practices, inclusionary collective action, or both. Much will depend on the specific common pool context and history of the fishery.

983,Tilapia lake virus threatens tilapiines farming and food security: Socio-economic challenges and preventive measures in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Tilapia is a traditional dish in most countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A deadly disease caused by a virus named Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) currently threatens tilapia production and fisheries. The objective of this study was to describe TiLV disease, discuss its related socio-economic impacts in SSA, and envisage preventive measures applicable in SSA countries. The methodology was based on an exhaustive search on TiLV in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and ResearchGate. Results revealed that TiLV is an RNA virus causing the disease of up to 90% mortalities in tilapia. It affects all developmental stages, however, tilapia fingerlings and juveniles seem to be more vulnerable. TiLV is transmitted horizontally between infected and naÃƒÂ¯ve fish in the aquatic environment and is a potential trade-influencing transboundary animal disease. The disease is currently confirmed in eight countries such as Ecuador, Israel, Colombia, Egypt, Thailand and Taiwan, India and Malaysia. However, subclinical infections have been detected in the Tanzanian and Ugandan basins of Lake Victoria. Reports show that at least 10 SSA countries have likely imported TiLV infected tilapia fries and fingerlings from hatcheries in Thailand whereby Burundi, Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo, Zambia, Tanzania and Uganda are now suspected infected with TiLV with the two latter recently confirmed. SSA is a newly reported region of TiLV circulation and all tilapia farming countries in the region may have theoretical risk of infection. It poses a major threat to fish supplies and the nutritional status in populations that eat tilapia on a regular basis and likely constitutes a food security issue. Over 150,000 tons of tilapia from tilapia farming and more from the tilapia fisheries with their associated costs could be threatened in SSA due to TiLV. Some control measures recommended by OIE and FAO may not be practical for countries in SSA region, and farmers can hardly comply with biosecurity measures or afford vaccination unless vaccines are thermostable, require no sophisticated technology for administration and are cost-effective to small-scale rural farmers. There is a crucial need for capacity building among farmers and technical personnel on diagnostic procedures and effective remedial action, creation of awareness among farmers on TiLV management and establishment of diagnostic and outbreak response systems. We encourage the creation of a Community-Based Fish Health Insurance funds (CBFHI) among small-scale fish farmers for outbreak prevention and control at local levels.

Olaikuda is a fishing hamlet with 1,000 traditional fishers who are primarily involved in trap fishing. An attempt was made to supplement their income under the societal development initiative of the NIOT. With the active participation of the local fishers of Olaikuda, 3,000 hatchery-produced cobia, Rachycentron canadum (Linnaeus, 1766) fingerlings were stocked equally in two cages with a stocking density of 4.7 fingerlings.m-3. The cobia stocked in sea cages were reared with the locally available low-value fishes for 8 months. The sea farmed cobia attained an average weight of 3.3 kg resulting in an average daily growth rate of 13.5 g with a survival rate of 75 %. The fish were harvested on the 245th day of culture, which yielded 7,000 kg of marketable size cobia fish (1st cage 3,687 kg and 2nd cage 3,313 kg with an FCR of 1:5.5). The harvested fish were sold at the farm gate price of USD4.42 kg-1, fetched USD30911.84. The economic analysis revealed a profit margin of USD1.26 kg-1. The parameters such as cost of production, productivity, profitability, socio-economic impacts of native fishers were analysed during the study. The result of this farmer-driven attempt is encouraging the farmers across the coastal states to do cage culture farming in a big way.

It is recommended that appropriate policies should be introduced for the management of natural resources. Property rights could be granted to communities to manage natural resources such as fish and veld products in line with the wildlife model for community based natural resources management (CBNRM).

Among the interventions for sustainable land use of Nigeria's dry belts are: afforestation programme, seedling production project, forest reserve development, forest shelterbelt project fuelwood poles and small timber supply project, rural tree planting programme, village woodlot scheme, tannin industrial project, gum Arabic production project and protective plantation of water catchment and dam areas. Others are land reclamation and road side planting, adaptive forest research, second forestry programme, urban forestry, fauna preservation protection and control projects. Others intervention activities are ECWA community based development, Northeast arid zone development programme, agricultural development project, hadejia-Ngure wetlands conservation projects, farm forestry, sand dune fixation, annual tree planting campaign, community awareness and mass mobilization, environmental education and training, and community fish pond.

987,Community based fishery management within the Menai bay conservation area: A survey of the resource user,"Management strategies are challenging to implement in Zanzibar's fisheries because the local people depend upon these resources for basic subsistence. This difficulty epitomizes the vital need for sustainable management: the more people need a fishery, the harder it is to limit fishing to allow regeneration. Comparing fisheries management strategies in two coastal villages in Unguja, the largest island of Zanzibar, Tanzania, this paper confirms the results of existing scholarship that communitybased strategies provide the most promising solutions to this challenge. Interviews with officials from the Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources, Village Fishermen Committees, and 51 fishermen in the villages of Kizimkazi Dimbani and Jambiani reveal the efficacy of strategies where local fishermen are centrally involved. The fishermen interviews reveal ignorance of existing fishing regulations and a lack of enforcement while fishermen at both sites noted that many illegal methods of fishing are still in use and expressed concern that such methods damage fish stocks. The Village Fishermen Committees, a recently implemented community-based initiative, are well attended by fishermen, and constitute a management strength that this paper concludes should be the foundation of future policy. To be successful, these committees need additional educational and financial resources.

988,"Conservation of a river for biodiversity and ecosystem services: the case of the Halda Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the unique river of Chittagong, Bangladesh","The Halda is the only tidal freshwater river in the world where major Indian carps spawn naturally. The river also serves as a source of drinking and irrigation water, a fishing ground and a means of water transportation. We investigated the biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Halda in the context of the conservation of this river in cooperation with river-dependent community and challenges thereof. The primary and secondary field data have been collected from relevant government and non-governmental organizations using both structured and semi-structured questionnaires. According to our calculations, the total economic worth of benefits derived from provisioning services of the Halda was approximately BDT (Bangladesh Taka) 1753 million. Irrigation and drinking water were the major contributors with BDT 1333 and 122 million, respectively. Carp spawning has lower primary economic worth (BDT 10 million) but it has a much bigger impact, as it supplies fish fries to the whole country. The river supports temporary and permanent livelihood for egg and fry collectors (approximately 2000), fishermen (approximately 350), boatmen (approximately 250), boat building and mending (approximately 150), sand quarrying (approximately 760), which creates a cumulative worth of BDT 283 million. The sustained flow of provisioning service from the Halda explains the willingness to contribute money (54 million) and time (average 6.6 hours/month) by local communities for conserving this river. Half of the respondents, though illiterate, have shown genuine concern about the future of the river. The sustainable flow of services and enhancement in their economic output require conservation and scientific management of the Halda. The community willingness and its dependence, as unearthed by our research, provides compelling ground for community-based conservation and management of the river. Future conservation projects and management plans for this river should involve local communities to avail their willingness to conserve this river while sustaining their livelihood through enhancement of economic output from it.

990,"Do fishers need to diversify their source of income? A special reference in vulnerable fishers of cilacap waters, Indonesia","The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of the variables of age, education, catch, and the number of family dependents, both together and separately, in diversified business activities of small-scale fishers in Cilacap. The study also aims to analyze the differences between the household incomes of the fishers who only fishing and the fishers who do diversification (processing). The used sampling method is simple random sampling. The total number of respondents = 60. In total, 41 respondents are fishers who simply live from fishing and 19 respondents are fishers who fish and perform diversification. The research used the analytic method called logistic regression. Based on the results of the logistic regression, we concluded that the variables of age, education, catch, and the number of family dependents together and separately result in a significantly positive sign toward the diversification of fishing. Fishers are still highly dependent on the catches of local fish stocks, with the contribution of utilization up to 68% of annual income. Fishers who choose to not diversify are mostly less educated, are not at a productive age, catch very little and have a small number of family dependents. It becomes necessary to strengthen institutional fishers and fisheries management resources/community-based co-management. To enhance the role of local institutions, priority programs should be implemented that provide training towards fish processing business diversification and form a joint venture for fisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wivesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ groups.

992,Strengthening community and stakeholder participation in the implementation of integrated vector management for malaria control in western Kenya: a case study,"Background: Integrated vector management (IVM) is defined as a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. The IVM approach is based on the premise that effective control of vectors and the diseases they transmit is not the sole preserve of the health sector. It requires the collaboration and participation of communities and other stakeholders in public and private sectors. Community participation is key to the success of IVM implementation at the local level. Case description: The study was conducted in Nyabondo, a rural area of Kenya where malaria is endemic. The objective of the project was to promote adoption and sustainability of IVM and scale up IVM-related activities as well as increase community participation and partnership in malaria control through outreach, capacity-building and collaboration with other stakeholders in the area. Collaboration was pursued through forging partnership with various government departments and ministries, particularly the fisheries department, ministry of education, ministry of health, forestry department and the social services. In total, 33 community-based organizations working within the area were identified and their role documented. Through distribution of information, education and communication (IEC) materials alone, the project was able to reach 10,670 people using various social mobilization methods, such as convening of sensitization meetingsÃ¢â‚¬â€dubbed 'mosquito days'Ã¢â‚¬â€mainly spearheaded by primary school pupils. A total of 23 local primary schools participated in creating awareness on malaria prevention and control during the project phase. The collaboration with other departments like fisheries led to stocking of more than 20 fishponds with a total of 18,000 fingerlings in the years 2017 and 2018. Fish ponds provided an opportunity for income generation to the community. In partnership with the county government health department, the project was able to re-train 40 CHVs on IVM and malaria case management in the area. Additionally, 40 fish farmers were re-trained on fish farming as part of income generating activity (IGA) while 10 CBOs made up of 509 members received both eucalyptus and Ocimum kilimandscharicum seedlings that were distributed to four CBOs composed of 152 members. Four primary schools made up of 113 health club members also received eucalyptus seedlings as part of IGA in addition to fish farming. In total, around 20,000 eucalyptus seedlings were distributed to the community as part of IGA initiatives. By the end of 2018, the project was able to reach 25,322 people in the community during its two-year advocacy and social mobilization initiatives. Conclusion: Through advocacy and social mobilization, the IVM strategy improved inter-sectoral collaboration, enhanced capacity building and community participation. However, more IVM related activities are needed to effectively mobilize available resources and increase community participation in malaria control.

993,Community-based governance of coastal zone and marine resources in Madagascar,"On account of the ""legal transplant"" of French civil law into traditional customary law in Madagascar, the traditional social code generally known as ""Dina"" has coexisted with the modern law since the pre-colonial era and has conditioned the implementation of such law. The concept and use of Dina has been influenced by that process. This paper illustrates the role of Dina as a mechanism for reconciling modern decentralized and traditional governance of marine resources and the coastal zones in Madagascar. Democratic participation is important for enforcing the regulations governing marine resources and coastal zones. As law should be the will of people themselves, it is therefore necessary to develop legislation in community forum such as through Dina. It is especially critical that regulations be imbued with community aspiration and culture so that the population can respect laws freely. The three cases cited in this paper illustrate the different ways in which Dina may be used depending on the interests of the actors. Integrating the 'legal' and the 'legitimate' is a big challenge. In some cases, this legal mechanism is not successful at protecting local community or fishermen rights. Given the potential for integrated coastal zone management and community-based management, Dina may be strengthened in order to more effectively protect local people's rights. Ã‚Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

994,The role of local taboos in the management of marine fisheries resources in Tanzania,"Contemporary government rules for fisheries resources management in developing countries have been challenged for their inadequacy. The search for modern management models for coastal and marine resources could be usefully informed by wealth of traditional knowledge that enabled communities to sustainably live with their environment for centuries or millennia. Local taboos, defined as implicit or explicit social rules prohibiting certain actions, have played an important part in many traditional approaches to resource use. A mixed methods approach was used to investigate how local taboos play a role in the management of fisheries resources in some rural and urban coastal communities of Tanzania. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews, participant observations and questionnaire surveys were used to gather primary data. Data were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The study identified a number of potential local taboos in the management of fisheries resources and their habitats in coastal Tanzania. While these taboos showed some potential for applications in modern management approaches, a majority of fishers indicated non-compliance to most of them, especially in urban areas. A number of reasons are revealed to have attributed to the non-compliance of these taboos. These findings suggest the prospect for judicious integration of traditional practices with modern strategies, to enhance compliance. More studies on traditional knowledge that has a role in fisheries resources management are recommended, as are biophysical assessments in conjunction with traditional practices to reveal their scientific benefits. Successful community-based fisheries resources management in Tanzania will draw on modern and traditional perspectives.

995,"Effects of landscape features on population genetic variation of a tropical stream fish, Stone lapping minnow, Garra cambodgiensis, in the upper Nan River drainage basin, northern Thailand","Spatial genetic variation of river-dwelling freshwater fishes is typically affected by the historical and contemporary river landscape as well as life-history traits. Tropical river and stream landscapes have endured extended geological change, shaping the existing pattern of genetic diversity, but were not directly affected by glaciation. Thus, spatial genetic variation of tropical fish populations should look very different from the pattern observed in temperate fish populations. These data are becoming important for designing appropriate management and conservation plans, as these aquatic systems are undergoing intense development and exploitation. This study evaluated the effects of landscape features on population genetic diversity of Garra cambodgiensis, a stream cyprinid, in eight tributary streams in the upper Nan River drainage basin (n=30-100 individuals/location), Nan Province, Thailand. These populations are under intense fishing pressure from local communities. Based on 11 microsatellite loci, we detected moderate genetic diversity within eight population samples (average number of alleles per locusD10.99Ã‚Â±3.00; allelic richnessD10.12Ã‚Â±2.44). Allelic richness within samples and stream order of the sampling location were negatively correlated (P &lt; 0:05). We did not detect recent bottleneck events in these populations, but we did detect genetic divergence among populations (Global FST = 0.022, P &lt; 0:01). The Bayesian clustering algorithms (TESS and STRUCTURE) suggested that four to five genetic clusters roughly coincide with sub-basins: (1) headwater streams/main stem of the Nan River, (2) a middle tributary, (3) a southeastern tributary and (4) a southwestern tributary. We observed positive correlation between geographic distance and linearized FST (P &lt; 0:05), and the genetic differentiation pattern can be moderately explained by the contemporary stream network (STREAMTREE analysis, R2 = 0.75). The MEMGENE analysis suggested genetic division between northern (genetic clusters 1 and 2) and southern (clusters 3 and 4) sub-basins. We observed a high degree of genetic admixture in each location, highlighting the importance of natural flooding patterns and possible genetic impacts of supplementary stocking. Insights obtained from this research advance our knowledge of the complexity of a tropical stream system, and guide current conservation and restoration efforts for this species in Thailand.

996,Development of a community-Based approach to opisthorchiasis control,"A liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrrini (OV), is the major cause of the high incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in North-eastern Thailand. The prevalence of OV infection remains high in various parts of the country, especially in wetland rural areas where a large proportion of the community work in agriculture and continue the traditional practice of eating raw or uncooked cyprinoid fish products. The national control program seems to have had little impact in many of these areas, and it has been difficult to make precise assessments of the overall effectiveness of the program. Therefore there is a need for a community-based approach to prevent infection with the parasite, ideally involving as many players as possible. Here we document an attempt to assess the best means to prevention on the basis of a community intervention in three villages in north-east Thailand, with participation of representatives of Health Promotion Hospitals of the Ministry of Public Health with dedicated staff, but also school teachers, independent government sponsored village health volunteers, and housewives responsible for cooking and diet selection.

997,Socio-economic development of marine ornamental reef fish fishers in eastern Sri Lanka through the lenses of Human Development Index,"Marine ornamental reef (MOR) fishery in Sri Lanka expanded to the commercial level only after the 1950 s. Although MOR fishery is contributing significantly to the socio-economic development of the country, studies are scarce to assess the socio-economic status of fishers engaged in the fishery. The present study aimed to assess the socio-economic development of MOR fisher communities in the Trincomalee district, which is considered a hotspot for the MOR fishery in Sri Lanka through the lenses of the Human Development Index (HDI). Fisher communities associated with reefs at Sampur, Pulmodai and Kuchchaweli in Trincomalee were comprehensively studied focussing on full-time reef fishers (n = 90). Results indicated that the fisher income was several folds higher than the minimum monthly wage of workers in the country (10,000 LKR, Ã¢â€°Ë†50 USD). Higher income gained by MOR fishers (30,000Ã¢â‚¬â€œ300,000 LKR, Ã¢â€°Ë†150Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1500 USD) was conspicuously reflected by having high human, physical and health capital, all of which resulted from high financial capital. Income showed slight variations amongst communities based on the species being fished. Consequently, study communities held high Schooling Index (SI), Health System Index (HSI) and Economic index (EI) all of which are modified sub-indices of the common HDI. Human Development Index linked to Ornamental Fisheries (HDIOF) which is the weighted sum of SI, HIS and EI shows a medium level development in the MOR fisher communities at Trincomalee. The present study affirms that HDIOF is a promising indicator to elucidate the socio-economic status of the MOR fisher communities in Sri Lanka.

999,"Governance assessment of small-scale inland fishing: The case of Lake Itezhi-Tezhi, Zambia","The small-scale fishing sector in sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing multiple challenges, mainly related to various governance issues. This study assessed the governance approach at a small-scale Lake Itezhi-Tezhi fishery, Zambia and how it relates to sustainable fishing. Data were collected through a mixed-methods approach. The governance approach was assessed by legitimacy criterion. The study revealed that there was no co-management in place but a dual governance approachÃ¢â‚¬â€fishing community-based approach and central government-controlled approach. Both were ineffective, mainly due to lack of adherence to the legislation for local community participation in fisheries governance and an inadequate policy framework to guide the governance process. Also, the governance approaches lacked legitimacy with stakeholders. As such, unsustainable fishing practices had continued. To move towards sustainable fishing at the fishery, the study suggested the following measures: active stakeholders' collaboration and engagement with the government for prompt implementation of legislation that promotes active local fishers' participation; establishment of an appropriate fisheries policy; and ultimately, a transformation of the current governance approach into a legitimate co-management governance approach.

1000,Changing boundaries and institutions in environmental governance: Perspectives on sector management of the Northeast US groundfish fishery,"Management through and by sectors has emerged as the primary mechanism for managing the Multispecies Groundfish Fishery in the Northeast United States. Sectors are cooperative associations of fishermen that in theory can pursue their own community-based goals but that in practice have tended to operate more like individual quotas. Based on interviews with groundfish sector managers, this paper examines the emergence of sectors as a new institutional form in the Northeast, and the rapid reorganization of the industry that has occurred in the wake of sectors. Some sectors have depended on existing relationships, particularly in sectors based on common ports, ethnicity, or kinship. But sectors also call on new sets of relationships and roles, such as the role of sector managers as important new bridges or ""boundary agents"" between government and industry. This paper reviews the differences and commonalities in the goals and objectives of different sector groups, the challenges and opportunities fishermen have faced adapting to the sector system in the context of reduced allocations, as well as the changing importance of different institutional forms in the management of the fishery. The sector system has been an experiment in decentralized and collaborative management, but in a context of increasingly privatized resources, rendering challenges and opportunities to fishermen in a rapidly changing socio-ecological environment.

1001,A SocialÃ¢â‚¬â€œEcological Systems Approach to Assessing Conservation and Fisheries Outcomes in Fijian Locally Managed Marine Areas,"Locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are often recommended as a strategy to achieve conservation and fisheries management, though few studies have evaluated their performance against these objectives. We assessed the effectiveness of eight periodically harvested closures (PHCs), the most common form of management within Fijian LMMAs, focusing on two outcomes: protection of resource units and biodiversity conservation. Of the eight PHCs, only one provided biodiversity benefits, whereas three were moderately successful in protecting resource units (targeted fish biomass). Protection of resource units was more likely when PHCs were harvested less frequently, less recently, and when total fish biomass in open areas was lower. Our findings further suggest that monitoring, enforcement, and clearly defined boundaries are critical, less frequent harvesting regimes are advised, and culturally appropriate management incentives are needed. Although PHCs have some potential to protect resource units, they are not recommended as a single strategy for broad-scale biodiversity conservation.

This study was undertaken to assess the species diversity, growth status, and bio-volume of Taia riparian forest for community-based conservation intervention. In this study, we enumerated 602 individual trees, which comprised 49 species that belong to 37 genera in 25 families. In total, 14 rectangular plots of dimension 20 Ãƒâ€” 50 m2 were demarcated. All trees species within the sampled plots having diameter at breast height [Dbh] Ã¢â€°Â¥7 cm were identified and height measured using the Haga altimeter, girth and measuring tape to determine the growth status. The result shows that 83% of the trees enumerated have [Dbh] that range from 7 to 30 cm, whereas 17% had [Dbh] greater than 30 cm. Funtumia africana and Trichilia heudelotii were the dominant species in almost all aspects in the study area. Meliaceae, Apocynaceae, and Mimosaceae were the dominant families with the highest species. The Shannon diversity index was 3.094, whereas the Simpson and Evenness diversity was 0.9303 and 0.4502, respectively.

Height and [Dbh] were not significantly correlated with the biovolume. Biotic pressure such as fuelwood collection, unsustainable charcoal production, pole harvesting, bushfires, and other traditional and cultural functions contributes greatly to the exploitation of the riparian forest.

1003,Arapaima co-management through the lens of the Protected Areas Assets Framework,"An extensive network of Protected Areas (PA) has been established across the Brazilian Amazon, but this PA system still suffers from a shortage of funding resources and environmental managers. New conservation strategies that successfully align social aspirations with biodiversity conservation are therefore imperative. Although approaches exist that demonstrate the value of biodiversity conservation for society and the local/national economy, these do not always manage to capture intrinsic values or local perspectives on natural resource conservation, and this can generate limitations in the use of these approaches as conservation tools. Here, we assessed the case of arapaima (Arapaima spp.) co-management, a well-consolidated community-based conservation initiative, through the lens of the Protected Areas Asset Framework (PAAF) to investigate the material and immaterial value of PA assets. Arapaima was clearly recognized as a key biophysical natural asset by local communities, with a significant role in terms of food, cultural, economic and conservation importance, in addition to its status as an iconic and emblematic species. This study reinforces the potential of the PAAF to identify the diverse range of values associated with PAs.

1004,Facing limits in oceanic fisheries: Part II: The social consequences,"Research from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and fishery scientists indicates that the wild catch of fish and other marine life from the oceans will not be able to increase significantly in the future, except through rehabilitation and better management of stocks. Despite the limited potential for bigger catches, fishing fleets have expanded rapidly in recent decades under government subsidies. Fishers now have approximately twice the capacity necessary to make the annual catch from the oceans. The juxtaposition of natural limits and overinvestment has created a crisis situation for the world's fishers, fishing communities, and traditional fishing cultures. Part I of this article (Natural Resources Forum, November 1994) discussed policy responses at the national and international level. How policy makers respond to the overextension of the marine fishing industry will determine the extent of job loss, hunger and dislocation that will result. Part II examines the social aspects of the world's fishing industry, including the demography of fishers, utilization of fisheries products, the relative social contribution of aquaculture and policy responses to overcapacity. Policy makers could enhance the social benefits of marine fisheries Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both jobs and food Ã¢â‚¬â€œ through a combination of government oversight and communityÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management. 1995 United Nations",NA,No,The paper does not provide any information about a case study from the specified countries.," No; The abstract does not mention any specific case study from the listed countries.

1005,Biophysical indicators and Indigenous and Local Knowledge reveal climatic and ecological shifts with implications for Arctic Char fisheries,"Managing Arctic marine resources to be resilient to environmental changes requires knowledge of how climate change is affecting marine food webs and fisheries. Changes to fishery resources will have major implications for coastal Indigenous communities whose livelihoods, health, and cultures are strongly connected to fisheries. Understanding these broad social-ecological changes requires a transdisciplinary approach bringing together contrasting and complementary disciplines and ways of knowing. Here, we examine climatic proxies, ecological, and fishery indicators (stable isotopes, fish condition, and lipid content), and interviews with Inuit fishers to assess how marine ecosystem changes have influenced Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) ecology and fisheries over a 30-year time period (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2016) in the Kitikmeot region of the Canadian Arctic. Inuit fishers reported several observations of environmental changes, including longer ice-free seasons, warmer ocean temperatures, and the arrival of new marine species. Biophysical data revealed important changes toward earlier dates of ice breakup (>12 days in some areas) and a shift in isotopic niche reflecting a changing Arctic Char diet, with increased contribution of pelagic carbon and higher trophic level prey. Fish condition was improved in years with earlier ice breakup, as observed by both Inuit fishers and biophysical indicators, while lipid content increased through time, suggesting that longer ice-free seasons may have a positive effect on Arctic Char quality as reflected by both fish condition and lipid content. Long-term impacts of continuing climate change, however, such as the northward expansion of boreal species and increasing ocean temperatures, could have negative effects on fisheries (e.g., physiological impairment in fish if temperatures exceed their thermal range). Continuous community-based monitoring that directly informs fisheries management could help communities and managers adaptively, and sustainably, manage in the face of multiple interacting changes in Arctic marine systems.

1006,Mangrove dependency and the livelihoods of coastal communities in Thailand,"From 1961 to 1996, Thailand lost 50-60% of its mangrove forests, mainly because of conversion to shrimp aquaculture. The speed and scale of deforestation have affected many coastal communities. This chapter highlights the importance of mangroves to four case study villages. Households depend directly on mangrove forests for fish and wood collection and/or benefit indirectly from the mangroves' support to coastal fisheries. Mangrove loss therefore affects the decision of households to look for outside employment. In response to deforestation, female household members allocate more hours to employment relative to mangrove-dependent activities, whereas males allocate fewer hours to outside work. Awareness of community conservation efforts and of the environmental damage imposed by shrimp farms also motivates households to participate in replanting activities. Efforts to control mangrove deforestation and promote community-based management of remaining mangrove forests, as well as replanting, would help to mitigate some of the worst impacts on coastal villages. By developing institutions to support local community management, the government of Thailand could help avoid excessive mangrove deforestation and conflicts over uses. Such a framework could also provide important lessons in coastal resource management for other countries in South-east Asia and elsewhere.

1007,Everything in the water column is connected: Traditional ecological knowledge of floodplain fishers of Bangladesh,"With ongoing resource depletion and environmental degradation in the floodplains of Bangladesh, there is a clear need to include insights from traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in developing and implementing plans for sustainable natural resource management. The knowledge, skills, and practices related to fishing in the floodplains of Bangladesh are almost exclusively a product of the local fishers' TEK. As fishers are deeply integrated with their landscapes, they develop and refine their ecological knowledge through multi-generational sharing of experience of and knowledge about fishing and socio-cultural learnings. This study documents the knowledge of floodplain fishers of Bangladesh and examines their decision-making about harvesting as a process based on heuristic rules developed through years of curiosity experimentation, adaptive learning, and empirical and inductive reasonings. Using a participatory ethnographic approach, ten major categories of TEK systems are examined: Ethno-topography of floodplains, ethno-taxonomy and aquatic productivity, diurnal and nocturnal variation patterns of fish behavior, birds and other animals, actions for aggregating fish in leased waterbodies, importance of aquatic vegetation for growth and conservation of floodplain fisheries, breeding biology tuned to complex hydrological cycles, fishers' perception of fish ulcerative syndrome, landlocked Hilsa fish from the Hakaluki haor, and fishers' views on biodiversity. This research explores the cognitive mechanisms behind fishers' decision-making about harvesting. Experienced fishers argue that if the important mother fishery sites are protected and managed through community-based institutions, floodplains of the country would benefit immensely in terms of production and biodiversity conservation.

1008,Implementing participatory monitoring in river management: The role of stakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perspectives and incentives,"Involving local stakeholders in monitoring has the potential to stimulate learning and improve management responses. However, there is limited understanding about factors which influence implementation and success. This paper reviews local stakeholdersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perceptions with respect to the construction of longitudinal dams in the Dutch river Waal, and explores their incentives to be involved in monitoring the effects of this intervention. Interviews with key stakeholders showed that concerns and (dis)trust are important incentives for participating in monitoring. Surveys of local residents, recreational anglers and boaters, and shipping professionals mapped their level of trust, attachment to the river landscape and evaluation of the effects of the longitudinal dams. Our case study shows that incentives for participation differ between stakeholder groups, and that research into their perceptions of the local environment can inform water managers on how to involve these groups in participatory monitoring.

1009,Determinants of sustainability in recycling of municipal solid waste: Application of community-based social marketing (CBSM),"Waste management and promotion of source separation by the public requires identification of the determinants of waste separation behavior, raising awareness, and reinforcing such behaviors. The present study aimed to determine the status of source separation behavior and identify the barriers, benefits, and factors affecting this behavior in Iran. This is a descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study conducted on 300 women selected through stratified sampling. The questionnaire applied included three sections. The validity and reliability of the self-made questionnaire were confirmed. In this study, descriptive statistics including the percentage, frequency, mean and standard deviation were used to describe the data, while chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied to analyze the data. Logistic regression test was also used to determine the predictors of waste separation behavior. Only 17.7% of the respondents separated the wastes regularly. The age, level of education, benefits (OR = 6.746; 95% CI = 2.534Ã¢â‚¬â€œ17.959), structural barriers (OR = 12.734; 95% CI = 3.516Ã¢â‚¬â€œ46.119), motivation (OR = 9.613; 95% C I= 3.356Ã¢â‚¬â€œ27.536), awareness (OR = 3.917; 95% CI = 3.351Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11.356), and social norms (OR = 2.905; 95% CI = 1.030Ã¢â‚¬â€œ8.191) were the determinants of source separation behavior. Considering the low participation rate in waste separation, efforts required to enhance such behavior need proper policy-making, training programs, and infrastructure to encourage the individuals to participate actively in waste separation. Educational interventions and campaigns are recommended to be designed to raise awareness and empower people.

1010,Why the path to polycentricity matters: evidence from fisheries governance in Palau,"Polycentricity, a complex form of governance characterized by multiple centers of semiautonomous decision-making, has been embraced by commons scholars for the governance of complex natural resource systems. In this context, several benefits are commonly ascribed to polycentric governance systems, including enhanced adaptive capacity, mitigation of risk and provision of good institutional fit. We examine the functioning of a polycentric governance system through a qualitative case study of the governance of small-scale fishing in the Northern Reef region of Palau where fishery resources have been declining in recent decades. By engaging a theoretical model of a functional polycentric governance system, we identify deficiencies in institutional features that partly explain why functionality is not fully achieved. Analysis of the historical transition of the governance system from community-based to polycentric reveals that the path to polycentricity and contextual conditions constitute additional distal explanations of deficiencies in functionality. The findings suggest that transitioning from community-based to polycentric governance risks producing conditions conducive to crowding-out and erosion of rule compliance where the form of polycentricity assumed entails primarily higher-level government decision-makers with insufficient capacity for rule implementation. The case underlines the need for more refined theory concerning the emergence and functionality of different forms polycentric governance systems in various contexts.

1012,"Effectiveness of village-based marine reserves on reef invertebrates in Emau, Vanuatu","Despite the current expansion of community-based marine conservation initiatives in the Pacific, few studies have specifically addressed their ecological efficiency to restore or enhance reef invertebrate resources. This paper investigated the effects of two very small (&lt; 0.05 km2) recent village-based marine reserves (tabu areas) located along the shallow fringing reef of Emau island, Vanuatu. Surveys focused on heavily harvested species (namely trochus, giant clams and green snails) and involved both experienced scientists and local villagers. Abundance, density and individual size data were collected by snorkelling along random transect belts located inside and outside the tabu areas, using simple PVC measuring tools specifically developed for participative monitoring. Habitat was assessed using a photographic method to quantitatively describe varied reef substrata. Resource recovery varied between the areas as a result of species-specific responses to contrasted reserve characteristics and local management practices. Fast-growing mobile Trochus niloticus exhibited strong positive abundance and size responses only within the older larger tabu area through the combined effects of protection from harvesting and translocation actions by local fishers. Similar trends were observed to a lesser extent for sessile slow-growing giant clams (Tridacna spp.), but these were not significant after four years of closure. Despite historical evidence of their presence in the area, surveys emphasized the severe population collapse of the heavily targeted green snail (Turbo marmoratus). Under certain conditions, very small-scale reserves, such as those implemented by village-based conservation initiatives, can rapidly and efficiently enhance local reef invertebrate resources. It is still unclear whether the changes are sufficient to restore critical levels of spawning biomass at larger scale and reverse the severe depletion of invertebrate resources occurring in Vanuatu.
