0,A comparison of frameworks and objectives for implementation of marine protected areas in Northern Europe and in Southeast Asia,"A proliferation of marine protected areas around the world, including Europe and Southeast Asia, is evidence of a growing global concern for the marine environment and its living resources. While marine protected areas in Europe on a wider scale have generally been considered a tool for either nature conservation or a technical measure in management of fisheries, overall management objectives of marine protected areas in Southeast Asian countries have varied more significantly between countries and sites due to differences in societal needs and opportunities, spatial scales, environmental conditions and varying threats. These differences have resulted in different approaches to marine protected area development and management. Management of the Northern European marine environment and its living resources is highly sectoral and largely determined by central directives and policies stemming from the European Union, such as the Habitats Directive and the Common Fisheries Policy. This paper however, will touch upon an ongoing evolution within the European Union from a strictly sectoral approach to marine protected areas and marine management, towards a more integrated, ecosystem approach to management of fisheries and the marine environment. In Southeast Asia, marine protected area development is usually determined by individual governments, municipalities and coastal communities, based upon specific needs and settings. Examples of such marine protected areas in Vietnam and the Philippines will be described, including their underlying institutional frameworks and objectives such as tourism, management of artisanal fisheries, etc. Examples of differences and similarities between Northern European and Southeast Asian marine protected areas will be presented and areas in which regions might learn from one another identified. For instance, where Southeast Asian protected areas have addressed the inevitable interdependency between healthy ecosystems and sustainable coastal fisheries for decades, marine protected areas in Northern Europe usually address either large scale management of stocks of individual fish species or nature conservation. Tourism has long been an overarching driving force in marine protected area implementation in SE Asia, while in Northern Europe especially this has only had little influence on overall objectives pertaining to the marine environment.

1,"Antenatal care in rural Bangladesh: Current state of costs, content and recommendations for effective service delivery","Background: Measurement of antenatal care (ANC) service coverage is often limited to the number of contacts or type of providers, reflecting a gap in the assessment of quality as well as cost estimations and health impact. The study aims to determine service subcomponents and provider and patient costs of ANC services and compares them between community (i.e. satellite clinics) and facility care (i.e. primary and secondary health centers) settings in rural Bangladesh. Methods: Service contents and cost data were collected by one researcher and four interviewers in various community and facility health care settings in Gaibandha district between September and December 2016. We conducted structured interviews with organization managers, observational studies of ANC service provision (n = 70) for service contents and provider costs (service and drug costs) and exit interviews with pregnant women (n = 70) for patient costs (direct and indirect costs) in health clinics at community and facility levels. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine any different patient characteristics between community and facility settings. ANC service contents were assessed by 63 subitems categorized into 11 groups and compared within and across community and facility settings. Provider and patient costs were collected in Bangladesh taka and analyzed as 2016 US Dollars (0.013 exchange rate). Results: We found generally similar provider and patient characteristics between the community and facility settings except in clients' gestational age. High compliance (> 50%) of service subcomponents were observed in blood pressure monitoring, weight measurement, iron and folate supplementation given, and tetanus vaccine, while lower compliance of service subcomponents (< 50%) were observed in some physical examinations such as edema and ultrasonogram and routine tests such as blood test and urine test. Average unit costs of ANC service provision were about double at the facility level ($2.75) compared with community-based care ($1.62). ANC patient costs at facilities ($2.66) were about three times higher than in the community ($0.78). Conclusion: The study reveals a delay in pregnant women's initial ANC care seeking, gaps in compliance of ANC subcomponents and difference of provider and patient costs between facility and community settings. © 2019 The Author(s).",NA,No,The paper does not meet the first Screening Criteria as it is not a case study from any of the listed countries.," No; The paper is focused on rural Bangladesh and does not mention any of the listed countries.

2,When a Shark Is More Than a Shark: A Sociopolitical Problem-Solving Approach to Fisher-Shark Interactions,"Fisheries are often conceptualized through a biophysical lens resulting in management approaches that fail to account for stakeholder conflicts and sociopolitical inequities. Using a fisher engagement approach, this case study examines the sociopolitical dimensions of fisher-shark interactions in pursuit of more complete problem definitions and effective solutions. Through interviews with Hawai‘i small boat fishers and observations of a community-based shark-tagging project, we examined fisher perspective, socioeconomic landscapes, stakeholder relationships, and power dynamics. We interpreted these data using an adapted framework that mobilizes concepts from conflict theory and problem definition. We discovered that economic cost, sharks as fishing competitors, and factors of fishers' on-the-water decisions define the fisher-shark interaction problem at the dispute level. Deeper conflicts include fishers' poor perceptions of management legitimacy, degraded relationships with researchers and managers, threatened fisher identities, and poor enforcement capacity. Together, dispute and deeper conflicts limit the effectiveness of singular approaches (e.g., regulation) to mitigate fisher-shark interactions and necessitate multi-pronged solutions with substance-, process-, and relationships-based components. This case study documented one such multi-pronged strategy employing fisher-researcher knowledge exchange, collaborative research, and means of more transparent communication. This strategy has the potential to affect both dispute- and deeper-level outcomes by advancing collective understanding of sharks and shark-handling tools, fisher behavior, and reducing shark mortality. Thus, a sociopolitical approach to problem-solving may yield greater collective benefits to fisheries stakeholders and sharks, with broader implications for the systemic management of complex human and biophysical ecosystem components.
